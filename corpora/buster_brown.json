["STORY I\n\n\n\nWHEN BUSTER WAS A CUB\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the North Woods where Buster was born, a wide river tinkles merrily\n\nover stones that are so white you’d mistake them for snowballs, if you\n\nwere not careful, and begin pelting each other with them. The birches\n\nhanging over the water look like white sticks of peppermint candy,\n\nexcept in the spring of the year when they blossom out in green leaves,\n\nand then they make you think of fairyland where everything is painted\n\nthe colors of the rainbow.\n\n\n\nThe rocks that slope up from the bank of the river are dented and\n\nbroken as if some giant in the past had smashed them with his hammer,\n\ncracking some and punching deep holes in others. It was in one of these\n\nholes, or caves, that Buster was born.\n\n\n\nHe didn’t mind the hard rocky floor of his bed a bit, nor did he mind\n\nthe darkness, nor the cold winds that swept through the open doorway.\n\nHe was so well protected by his thick, furry coat that he didn’t need\n\na soft bed on which to take his nap. A big stone made a nice pillow for\n\nhis head, and he rather liked the hard floor for a bed when he curled\n\nup to go to sleep.\n\n\n\nBuster was an only child. He didn’t know what a brother or sister was\n\nlike, and so he didn’t miss either. He had his mother, who was good\n\nenough for him, and when he was old enough to crawl out on the rocks in\n\nfront of his home he would spend hours and hours there playing with her\n\nin the bright sunshine.\n\n\n\nSometimes Mother Bear had to leave him while she went off in the woods\n\nto get something to eat. At such times she made Buster stay in the cave.\n\n\n\n“You mustn’t show yourself on the rock, Buster,” she cautioned, “until\n\nyou hear me call you. I won’t be gone long.”\n\n\n\nBuster was a dutiful little cub, and he accepted his mother’s commands\n\nwithout asking why or wherefore. Perhaps that was because he was too\n\nyoung to understand, or because his mother was very strict with her\n\nonly child. When he was very young, so young that he could hardly see\n\nat all, his mother used to tell him what to do and then gently but\n\nfirmly make him do it, using her big hairy paws to enforce obedience.\n\n\n\nThese early lessons were never forgotten, and Buster got in the habit\n\nof minding his mother just as naturally as a tree grows straight when\n\ntrained upright to a stake. But Buster grew curious as he got older,\n\nand one day when his mother was going away he asked: “Why can’t I play\n\nin front until you come back?”\n\n\n\n“Because,” replied Mother Bear, “Loup the Lynx might come along and eat\n\nyou up.”\n\n\n\n“Who is Loup the Lynx?” asked Buster, turning very pale, for he had a\n\nwholesome dread of being eaten up.\n\n\n\n“Never mind, dear. You stay inside until I come back.”\n\n\n\nThat was a mighty argument of Mother Bear’s to make her child obey. He\n\nwas so afraid of Loup the Lynx that he never dared to poke his nose out\n\nof the cave when his mother was away. And sometimes the temptation to\n\ndo it was very strong, for as he grew bigger and stronger the sunshine\n\nhad a great fascination for him. Nothing in the world seemed pleasanter\n\nthan to roll around on the rocks outside, blinking at the warm sun,\n\nand smelling the odors of the sweet flowers. It was springtime then,\n\nand the woods were full of the song of birds and the drone of busy\n\ninsects. It made one wish to be outdoors all the time.\n\n\n\n“You must be careful today, Buster,” his mother said to him one\n\nmorning, “and stay inside the cave. I heard Loup the Lynx hunting\n\naround here last night. I don’t like him. He’s a rough, brutal fellow,\n\nand nearly always up to some mischief. I hate to leave you a minute\n\ntoday. But I must.”\n\n\n\nBuster kept his promise, and remained inside all the morning, playing\n\nwith his tail and the few leaves the wind blew in the cave. Toward\n\nnoon, however, he got tired of this, and also very hungry. When a bear\n\nis hungry, he becomes very bold and will do things that would never\n\noccur to him at other times.\n\n\n\nBuster sniffed in all the corners of the cave for a bite of something\n\ngood to eat, but there was nothing more digestible than rocks and\n\nstones. Then he crept nearer the entrance, venturing a little closer\n\nevery moment.\n\n\n\nA streak of sunlight played on the rocks in front of him, and it so\n\nfascinated him that he began trying to catch it with his little paws.\n\nHe had it, then lost it, and then sprang for it again. But the sunlight\n\ndanced around, and never stayed caught.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of this game of tag with the sunlight, Buster heard a\n\nnoise outside. It sounded like some animal scuffing heavily over the\n\nrocks, and the little fellow was so sure it was his mother that he ran\n\nout to greet her.\n\n\n\nBut what a surprise met him! Instead of Mother Bear there stood Loup\n\nthe Lynx, crouching and sniffing, with his long tail swishing back and\n\nforth making a noise like a nutmeg grater.\n\n\n\nBuster had never seen Loup the Lynx before, but nobody had to tell him\n\nnow. He recognized him instantly. His first thought was to run back in\n\nthe dark cave. Loup had a great dread of being caught in the cave by\n\nMother Bear. If he had to fight with a full grown bear he preferred to\n\nbe out in the open where he could spring in a tree if knocked over by a\n\nbig paw. So he resorted to cunning to induce Buster to come out further.\n\n\n\n“Don’t be afraid, Buster,” he said pleasantly. “I’m not going to hurt\n\nyou. Your mother was delayed in the woods, and she sent me here to\n\nwatch the mouth of the cave so no harm would come to you.”\n\n\n\nBuster was surprised at this information, and he stopped to look at\n\nLoup. He didn’t like his face, but if his mother sent him it must be\n\nall right.\n\n\n\n“I was watching you playing with that sun-beam,” Loup continued, lying\n\ndown with his two paws in front of him. “I used to do that when I was\n\nyoung, but I’m too old now. I can’t jump around as I used to. Now let\n\nme see if you can catch the sun-beam.”\n\n\n\nBuster was less afraid than ever, and he wanted to show Loup how spry\n\nhe was. “I can catch it if I want to,” he said boastfully.\n\n\n\n“I don’t believe you can. Now let’s see you do it. If you do I’ll tell\n\nyour mother when she returns what a spry youngster you are.”\n\n\n\nBuster, swelling with pride and ambition, made a dart for the\n\nflickering sun-beam. At the same time Loup leaped into the air, and\n\nlanded right at the mouth of the cave, with Buster on the outside.\n\nHe was cut off from retreat, and Loup leered so cruelly at him that\n\na spasm of fear ran down his spine. He wished now that he hadn’t\n\ndisobeyed his mother, but it was too late, and he set up a little cry\n\nof terror.\n\n\n\nWhat Loup the Lynx did to him, and how Buster escaped to plunge into\n\nmore adventures, will be told in the next story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY II\n\n\n\nBUSTER AND LOUP\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a dreadful position for a little rolly polly bear to be in, with\n\nLoup the Lynx facing him, and his mother away in the woods where she\n\ncouldn’t hear his cries. Loup was so sure of his prize that he let him\n\nsqueal and cry for some time. It rather amused him.\n\n\n\n“What a little howling brat you are!” Loup said finally. “Stop that\n\nsquealing or I’ll make you.”\n\n\n\nBuster was as much frightened by the tone of the voice as by the words,\n\nand almost instantly stopped calling for his mother. He was a very\n\nyoung bear--a mere cub--and you could not blame him for crying for\n\nhelp. Besides he had never been outside of the cave alone before, and\n\nright down in his heart he knew that his disobedience of his mother’s\n\ncommands had got him into trouble.\n\n\n\n“I’ll stop,” he said, “if you’ll please move away from that doorway and\n\nlet me go inside. Mother told me not to come out of the cave when she\n\nwas away.”\n\n\n\n“Oh, she did!” sneered Loup. “Then you’ve been a bad, wicked cub, and\n\nyou deserve to be punished. I think I’ll teach you a lesson.”\n\n\n\n“Please don’t, Mr. Loup,” pleaded Buster, who much preferred to be\n\npunished by his mother than this wicked looking animal. “One punishment\n\nwill be enough, and I know mother will attend to that.”\n\n\n\nLoup laughed and swished his short tail as if he wished it were longer\n\nso he might use it as a whip to punish Buster with.\n\n\n\n“No, I’ll punish you too,” he added. “You deserve it. Do you know how I\n\npunish cubs that disobey their mothers?”\n\n\n\nBuster didn’t know, and wasn’t particularly anxious to find out. His\n\none desire was to get back of Loup and escape in the cave where he\n\nmight be able to hide until his mother returned. If he could only get\n\nLoup away from the front of the cave, he might run in it.\n\n\n\n“Well, I’ll tell you,” Loup added. “I take them by the scruff of the\n\nneck, and shake them until they haven’t breath enough to squeal.”\n\n\n\nHe grabbed a stone in his jaws and shook it back and forth just to show\n\nhow he would do it. The sight made Buster feel faint.\n\n\n\n“And then,” went on Loup, “I give them a pat on the back with my paw\n\nlike this.”\n\n\n\nLoup raised a paw and brought it down on the rock so hard that it made\n\nBuster jump a foot in the air. The blow was so powerful that it seemed\n\nfor a moment as if it would crack the rocks. Loup laughed joyfully at\n\nBuster’s fright.\n\n\n\n“Now that I’ve shown you what I intend to do with you,” Loup continued,\n\n“you’ll be prepared. Well, I’m coming now to punish you.”\n\n\n\nBuster backed away to the edge of the rock.\n\n\n\n“And when I’ve cuffed your ears, and shaken out your teeth,” Loup\n\nthreatened, “I’m going to eat you. Oh, yes, a young cub makes delicious\n\neating. I’ll fill my stomach with you.”\n\n\n\nFor the first time Buster showed a little spirit of defiance. Standing\n\nup on his two hind legs, he said, wagging his head: “No you won’t, Mr.\n\nLoup, for my mother will kill you first. She’s bigger than you, and she\n\ncan strike harder than you. My, when she brings her big paw down it\n\nmakes the rocks shake! If you touch me she’ll strike you on the head,\n\nand knock you in the river.”\n\n\n\n“Huh!” snorted Loup angrily. The fact was he was afraid of Mother Bear,\n\nbut he didn’t want Buster to know it, and he tried to make him think so\n\nby boasting. “If your mother should come near me, I’d knock her over.\n\nI could do it easily.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps Buster wasn’t convinced by this boastful talk, or may be he\n\nheard something in the bushes that sounded like his mother’s familiar\n\nfootsteps. At any rate, he turned suddenly, and clapped his paws.\n\n\n\n“Now let me see you do it, Mr. Loup!” he cried. “Here comes mother! She\n\nwon’t let you hurt me!”\n\n\n\nThe way Loup jumped and growled showed that his courage wasn’t so very\n\ngreat after all. He had no desire to meet Mother Bear, and the thought\n\nhe had lost a delicious dinner by talking so long to Buster made him\n\nhungry. For a moment he hesitated. If he jumped on Buster and ran away\n\nwith him, Mother Bear would be on his tracks immediately, and if he\n\nstayed he would be cornered in the cave. He decided to take the safest\n\ncourse.\n\n\n\n“Well, if your mother’s coming, Buster,” he said in a changed voice,\n\n“it won’t be necessary for me to stay here with you any longer. You\n\nmight tell her I kept guard over the cave while she was away.”\n\n\n\nBuster was so surprised by these words that he turned to look at the\n\nLynx. Loup smiled at him, and added: “Of course, you know this was all\n\na joke. I didn’t intend to hurt you. I love little bear cubs. That’s\n\nwhy I came here to protect you. We’ll always be great friends, and when\n\nyou grow up I’ll show you the ways of the woods.”\n\n\n\nBuster in his innocence believed these soft words, and his feelings\n\ntoward Loup took a sudden change. He wasn’t wise enough to follow up\n\nhis advantage and let Loup go. Instead he said:\n\n\n\n“Don’t go yet, Mr. Loup. I’m not sure mother is coming after all. The\n\nnoise in the bushes was just a bird scratching for worms.”\n\n\n\nLoup raised his ugly head and glanced around him. His ears were cocked\n\nup so that he could catch the faintest sound in the distance. Then a\n\nsmile of satisfaction spread over his face. Turning to Buster he let\n\nout a roar that sounded like distant thunder rumbling in the sky. It\n\nmade Buster jump nearly two feet in the air.\n\n\n\n“So you were trying to deceive me!” he growled. “You lied to me! You\n\nsaid your mother was coming when she wasn’t. Then for that I’ll kill\n\nyou and eat you up!”\n\n\n\nBuster started to protest. “No, no, Mr. Loup, I didn’t lie to you,” he\n\nstammered.\n\n\n\nBut he couldn’t get any further. Loup had crouched for a spring.\n\nBuster saw his big, dark body coming through the air at him, and very\n\nnaturally he ran away crying with fright. Loup seeing that he had\n\nmissed him in his spring struck viciously with one paw, and just grazed\n\nBuster’s head. It was only a graze, but it drew blood, and made Buster\n\nwhimper with pain.\n\n\n\nThere was one thing Buster wanted, and that was to get safely inside\n\nthe cave, and the moment Loup sprang in the air he started for it. But\n\nLoup was a quick, powerful dodger, and before the cub could reach the\n\nentrance the Lynx had taken another long jump and landed directly in\n\nfront of him.\n\n\n\nBuster, to escape him, wheeled so suddenly that he rolled all over in a\n\nheap. The rock sloped down toward the water, and the cub rolled down it\n\nso fast that Loup was unable to catch him. It was the only thing that\n\nsaved Buster’s life.\n\n\n\nHe had never been in the river, and he didn’t know whether he could\n\nswim or not, but he much preferred the water to Loup’s dripping jaws.\n\nSo instead of trying to check his rolling he kicked out to make himself\n\ngo faster.\n\n\n\nLoup reached him just as he got at the edge of the rocks, and with one\n\npaw tried to crush his head and body; but again he missed him, and\n\nmerely cut a deep gash in Buster’s shoulder. The next moment the cub\n\nsplashed into the river, and went down, down, down until it seemed to\n\nhim there was no bottom.\n\n\n\nIn the next story you will hear of how Buster was rescued from the\n\nriver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY III\n\n\n\nHOW BUSTER GOT OUT OF THE RIVER\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster had never been in water over his head before, and you can\n\nimagine his feelings when it got in his eyes, mouth, ears and nose. He\n\ncoughed and kicked, and made a great splutter, but after all it was\n\nmore fright than real danger. He was such a fat little cub that he\n\ncouldn’t sink to the bottom, and stay there.\n\n\n\nJust when he thought his end had surely come, he bobbed up on the\n\nsurface, and his head came out of the water. What a wonderful thing\n\nit was to inhale pure fresh air again! Buster had never realized how\n\ngood it was until then! Of course he had always breathed all the air he\n\nwanted, and so having enough he didn’t know what it meant to be without\n\nit for even a few seconds. That’s the way with a lot of things we have\n\nin this world.\n\n\n\nBuster inhaled the air in great gulps, filling his lungs until they\n\nswelled up like balloons, and then to his horror he felt himself\n\nsinking. The mere thought of going down in the water again terrified\n\nhim. He let out a squeal of fear, and began splashing with all four\n\npaws.\n\n\n\nThat was the best thing he could do, for a bear can swim without any\n\nlessons if he must do it to save his life. But it was a laughable sight\n\nto Loup the Lynx watching from the shore. Buster’s swimming was clumsy\n\nand awkward.\n\n\n\n“Ha! Ha!” laughed Loup gleefully. “Wag your tail, Buster, and maybe\n\nthat will help you! Don’t sneeze now, or you’ll swallow all the water\n\nin the river. That’s right, keep going around in a circle.”\n\n\n\nIt was cruel of Loup to poke fun at him, and Buster thought so too,\n\nbut he was so occupied in trying to keep his head above the surface he\n\ndidn’t have time to answer.\n\n\n\n“Come toward the shore, Buster, and I’ll help you,” Loup called\n\nfinally, running down to the edge, and wading knee-deep in the river.\n\n\n\nThis was the first kindly offer of the Lynx, and once more Buster began\n\nto think Loup was not so wicked after all, but when he had made his way\n\na few feet toward the shore he stopped. Why was Loup so anxious to save\n\nhim? Of course, there was only one explanation to it. He wanted to eat\n\nhim up.\n\n\n\nBuster turned suddenly and splashed away from the bank. Much as he\n\ndreaded death by drowning, he preferred it to being eaten up by Loup.\n\n\n\n“This way, Buster! This way!” called Loup, thinking that the cub had\n\ngot turned around and didn’t know which way he was swimming.\n\n\n\nBuster made no reply. He saw the opposite shore ahead. It was a long\n\ndistance away, but he was going to swim for it. He began splashing\n\nharder than ever.\n\n\n\n“I tell you to swim this way!” added Loup, growing suspicious and angry.\n\n\n\nBuster continued to head in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n“If you don’t come this way,” angrily cried Loup, “I’ll come after you,\n\nand hold your head under the water until you’re dead.”\n\n\n\nBuster more frightened than ever paddled desperately, and he was really\n\nmaking pretty good time. He was beginning to learn how to swim. The\n\nopposite bank was growing nearer every moment. To his surprise he found\n\nthat his strength was not leaving him, and he could keep his head up\n\nbetter than before. There was a chance of escaping the Lynx.\n\n\n\n“You little brat!” shrieked Loup, dancing around in the shallow water.\n\n“I’ll teach you to trick me!”\n\n\n\nLoup was an excellent swimmer, but he didn’t like the water. He hated\n\nto get his soft fur wet, for it took a long time to dry it in the sun.\n\nHe never took a swim unless forced to it either to catch his victim or\n\nto save his life.\n\n\n\nBut this was one of those occasions when he had to swim or lose his\n\nprey. Buster was surely escaping him. In a few more minutes he would\n\nbe on the opposite shore where he could hide in the bushes until his\n\nmother returned.\n\n\n\n“All right!” added Loup finally, making up his mind. “I’m coming for\n\nyou!”\n\n\n\nThese words didn’t frighten Buster nearly so much as the terrible\n\nsplash he heard a moment later behind him. It seemed as if the river\n\nrose a foot, and that big waves were dashing against the bank. Loup had\n\nrun up a tree leaning over the edge of the river, and launched himself\n\nfrom it. When his body struck the water it made a loud noise.\n\n\n\nBuster made a frantic effort to increase his speed, but once when he\n\nglanced over his shoulder he nearly lost heart. Loup was swimming with\n\ngreat powerful strokes which brought him closer every second. He didn’t\n\nsplash and flounder around in the water as the cub did, but, with all\n\nexcept his ugly head and long tail under the surface, he moved forward\n\nwith the least amount of friction. Loup swam as steadily and easily as\n\na boat propelled by a screw.\n\n\n\nBuster grew frantic with dread. He expected any moment to feel Loup’s\n\npowerful paw crushing down on his head, for right behind him he could\n\nhear the deep breathing of the Lynx. There was no hope--no escape!\n\n\n\n“Thought you’d get away from me, Buster, didn’t you?” laughed Loup when\n\nwithin a few yards of the cub. “Ha! Ha! This is delicious sport! Now\n\nI’m going to duck you and half drown you, and then duck you again.”\n\n\n\n“Oh, please, please--” gasped Buster, who was pretty well winded now.\n\n“Please let me go!”\n\n\n\nFor reply Loup laughed louder than ever. Then Buster thought of a\n\ntrick. This time he made it up, for he had heard nothing in the bushes\n\nto make him think his mother was returning. But under the circumstances\n\nyou can’t blame him for stretching the truth.\n\n\n\n“Oh, Loup, there’s mother coming!” he cried. “I must go to her at once!”\n\n\n\nLoup was not deceived this time. He took a cautious peep around him,\n\nand then splashed the water violently with his two front paws.\n\n\n\n“You can’t deceive me that way the second time, Buster,” he said. “Your\n\nmother isn’t coming. I’m going to kill you, and then take you up on the\n\nbank and eat you.”\n\n\n\n“But, Mr. Loup, I haven’t done anything to you. Won’t you let me go\n\nthis time? I’ll promise to be your friend, and--”\n\n\n\n“No!” roared the Lynx so loudly that the echo went ringing up and down\n\nthe river.\n\n\n\nHe raised a great paw to grasp Buster, who to escape it dove under the\n\nwater and disappeared for an instant; but he couldn’t stay there long,\n\nand when he reappeared there was the menacing paw raised to strike him.\n\n\n\nLoup really liked to torture his victims. It wasn’t his nature to kill\n\nthem outright. It gave him great pleasure to see them suffer. If he had\n\nstruck at Buster at once, he might have killed him in one blow; but\n\nhe didn’t, and that was what saved the little bear’s life. There was\n\nrescue at hand which neither one dreamed of.\n\n\n\nThere was a sudden splash in the water, and then a dull thud as\n\nsomething hard and heavy struck Loup on the nose. He jumped back with a\n\nscream of rage. At first he thought Buster had played a trick on him,\n\nbut when another heavy thing hit him on the back of the head he knew\n\ndifferently.\n\n\n\nFrom the shore there came excited cries. “Hit him again! Let me try him\n\nthis time!”\n\n\n\nLoup glanced that way, and understood instantly. Two men were standing\n\non the shore pelting him with rocks. Two of them had hit him, and\n\nothers were coming his way. There was no fight in Loup when caught\n\nin the water, and with a scream of rage he turned and swam for the\n\nopposite bank. He wasn’t going to risk the loss of his life for the\n\nsake of a good dinner.\n\n\n\nThe next story will tell how Buster met the men, and was carried away\n\nas a captive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY IV\n\n\n\nBUSTER IS CARRIED AWAY BY THE MEN\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster was nearly as much surprised as Loup by the sudden appearance of\n\nthe men, but he lacked the strength to turn and swim back to the other\n\nside of the river. Indeed, between fear and his hard struggle he was\n\nalmost ready to give up and sink. He felt he couldn’t take many more\n\nstrokes even to save his life.\n\n\n\nAt first he thought the rocks were being hurled at him, but as they\n\nfollowed Loup half way across the river, the men throwing them until\n\nthe Lynx was out of reach, he concluded that maybe he was safer on that\n\nside with the men than on the other with his old enemy. This belief was\n\nstrengthened when the men stopped bombarding the Lynx, and turned to\n\nBuster.\n\n\n\n“It’s a young bear!” said one of the men.\n\n\n\n“Sure! I told you so before. We must save him. Here, little fellow!\n\nCome here! We won’t hurt you!”\n\n\n\nBuster looked at them with eyes that seemed ready to pop out of his\n\nhead. He was so thankful that the men were not going to hurt him that\n\nhe swam straight toward them. One ran out to meet him, and caught him\n\nin his arms.\n\n\n\n“The poor little fellow’s hurt,” the man said, noticing the blood\n\non Buster’s shoulder where Loup’s claw had caught him when he first\n\ntumbled in the river.\n\n\n\n“I wish we had a gun to shoot that Lynx,” remarked the other. “I’ll\n\ncome back and lay for him.”\n\n\n\nThe man holding Buster stroked his head and back, as he carried him up\n\non dry land. “The poor little fellow’s tired out and half dead with\n\nfright,” he added.\n\n\n\n“And hungry, too,” said the second man. “We must find him some warm\n\nmilk. Got any in the camp?”\n\n\n\n“Nothing but condensed milk.”\n\n\n\n“Well, we’ll try him with that.”\n\n\n\nThey carried Buster up to their camp in the woods, and brought out a\n\ncan of condensed milk. After warming some of this over the fire, they\n\ngave it to Buster.\n\n\n\nNothing ever tasted so good as that milk, for Buster was cold, tired\n\nand still trembling from fright and weakness. He didn’t know it until\n\nthen, but he was dreadfully hungry, so hungry that he couldn’t stop\n\nuntil he had lapped up the last drop.\n\n\n\nThe two men watched him in silence, and then patted him on the back.\n\n“You were hungry, little chap, weren’t you?” remarked one. “Well,\n\nthat’s enough for the present. We don’t want to make you sick.”\n\n\n\n“Oh, give him a bit of this honey-comb for dessert. That won’t hurt\n\nhim.”\n\n\n\nAnd then to Buster’s delight, the man handed him something, the very\n\nodor of which sent the blood tingling through his veins. One taste of\n\nit, and Buster was in ecstasy. It was his first taste of honey, and the\n\ngrunt of pleasure that escaped his lips sent the men into a roar of\n\nlaughter.\n\n\n\n“The little chap’s having the time of his life,” one laughed. “Like\n\nOliver Twist he’ll be begging for more when that’s gone.” Of course,\n\nBuster didn’t know anything about Oliver Twist, but he did know that he\n\ncould eat that delicious honey all day, and when the last drop was gone\n\nhe did beg for more.\n\n\n\n“Stand on your hind legs and ask for it, and I’ll give it to you,” said\n\nthe man.\n\n\n\nBuster didn’t know exactly what he meant, but it was much easier to\n\nreach up to the hand containing the honey when he stood on two legs,\n\nand he unconsciously obeyed.\n\n\n\n“Now ask for it.”\n\n\n\nBuster opened his mouth and snapped at it, but the hand was raised\n\nbeyond his reach. Then, disappointed, he uttered a little cry of\n\neagerness. To his surprise the man gave him the honey.\n\n\n\n“That’s right,” he laughed. Then turning to his companion, he added:\n\n“I’m going to teach him tricks, Jim. You can teach a young cub almost\n\nanything if you begin early enough.”\n\n\n\nAll this was strange talk to Buster, but he had learned the first\n\nlesson of his new life--the trick of begging. After that when he wanted\n\nmilk or honey or anything else, he stood up on his hind legs and\n\ngrunted or cried for it. He found that he always got what he wanted in\n\nthis way.\n\n\n\nWith his little stomach full of rich milk and sweet honey, Buster grew\n\nvery sleepy, and when he curled up to rest one of his rescuers spread a\n\nwarm blanket over him. In a few minutes he was lost in slumberland.\n\n\n\n[Illustration: HE STOOD ON HIS HIND LEGS AND CRIED FOR IT]\n\n\n\nWhen Buster awoke he had a queer sensation of being carried in a\n\nhammock or something equally soft and comfortable. It was so different\n\nfrom his hard bed on the rocks! His first thought was that it was\n\nall part of a dream, but remembering his experience with Loup the Lynx\n\nhe shuddered, and set up a call for his mother. He was frightened, and\n\nwhimpered so loudly that the man carrying him opened the blanket and\n\npeeked in.\n\n\n\n“What is it, Buster?” he asked, addressing him by the very name his\n\nmother had always called him. “Hungry again?”\n\n\n\nBuster was indeed hungry again, but he was also homesick and wanted his\n\nmother. He kept on whimpering when the man took him out of the blanket\n\nand patted him.\n\n\n\n“Oh, give him something to eat, Bill, and stop his crying,” said the\n\nman’s companion.\n\n\n\nSo they stopped long enough to feed him again, and after that Buster\n\nfelt less homesick, and, it must be confessed, forgot his mother. The\n\nmen began playing with him, and Buster rolled over and gnawed at a\n\nstick for them until they roared with laughter.\n\n\n\n“Do you know, Jim,” said one of his captors, “we’ve got a rich prize in\n\nthat cub. He’s the most intelligent little chap I ever saw. I wonder\n\nwhere he came from.”\n\n\n\n“Probably his mother was killed, and that Lynx knew it, and was trying\n\nto make a dinner off him.”\n\n\n\n“I’d like to get a crack at that lynx some day.”\n\n\n\n“So would I. But I’m mighty glad we saved the cub. He’ll make a fine\n\npet. He’s as playful as a dog.”\n\n\n\nBuster was a little startled to hear that his mother had probably been\n\nkilled. That would account for her not returning to the cave when he\n\ncalled her. Had Loup killed her? No, Buster didn’t think so, for his\n\nmother was big and powerful, and could easily knock a lynx over with\n\none blow from her paw. Then who was her murderer, or wasn’t she dead?\n\n\n\nThese questions were too hard for Buster to answer, and he soon stopped\n\ntrying to think of them. Meanwhile, he was safe and well fed, and\n\nhis two captors liked him. Why should he worry about something that\n\ncouldn’t be helped?\n\n\n\nAt night time the men came to a cabin near the edge of the woods, and\n\nBuster was given a warm blanket in one corner of it. He watched them\n\ncook their evening meal, and ate whatever they fed him. The bacon\n\nsizzling in the frying pan smelt so good that Buster poked his nose in\n\nit, and then drew back with a howl of pain. It burnt his little nose\n\nand brought the tears to his eyes.\n\n\n\n“Let that be a lesson, Buster, not to poke your nose in things that\n\ndon’t belong to you,” laughed one of the men. Then he handed him a\n\npiece of bacon well cooked, and not too hot. Buster swallowed it in one\n\ngulp.\n\n\n\n“What are you going to do with the little fellow, Jim?” suddenly asked\n\none of the men. “You know we can’t keep him in the city.”\n\n\n\n“I’ve thought of that,” replied the other slowly. “The only thing we\n\ncan do is to sell him. He ought to be worth something.”\n\n\n\nThis was the first hint to Buster that he wasn’t always going to live\n\nwith his captors, and it made him very sad. When bears were sold, what\n\nbecame of them? Buster didn’t know, and he went to sleep very troubled.\n\nBut he wasn’t sold after all, and in the next story you will hear how\n\nhe was stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY V\n\n\n\nHOW BUSTER WAS STOLEN\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster remained three whole days in the camp with the two men who had\n\nsaved him from Loup the Lynx, and during that time he learned many\n\nthings that his mother had never taught him. For one thing he learned\n\nmanners.\n\n\n\nOne day he stuck his nose in the pot of soup on the table and began\n\nlicking it up until a hand grasped him by the neck, and jerked him\n\nback. “Buster, you’ve got to learn your manners, and the time to\n\nbegin is when you’re young,” said the man who held him. “Now I must\n\npunish you so you’ll never stick your nose in the soup again without\n\nremembering it.”\n\n\n\nWith that two sharp blows from a small stick landed on Buster’s nose.\n\nHe yelped with pain, and tried to run away, but his captor held him.\n\n“The next time you will get three blows instead of two,” he added\n\ngravely. Buster never repeated the offence.\n\n\n\nFor another thing he learned it paid to be obliging. When the men\n\nasked him to jump over a stick or dance on his hind legs, he received a\n\ndouble lump of sugar if he promptly obeyed. A little extra dance, or a\n\nnew kind of trick, always brought something to reward him. Buster was\n\nshrewd enough to connect the two together--the trick and the reward.\n\n\n\nBut there was one thing he hadn’t learned, and it got him in trouble\n\nagain just as it did that day when he disobeyed his mother in leaving\n\nthe cave when she was away. The men had to go away for a few hours, and\n\nthey shut Buster up in the cabin, with the remark:\n\n\n\n“You stay in here, Buster, and watch the camp. We’ll be back soon.”\n\n\n\n“Better close that window, Jim,” remarked the other. “He might climb up\n\nto it and get out.”\n\n\n\n“No, it will be too hot in here. Besides, I think we can trust Buster.\n\nHe won’t try to get out.”\n\n\n\nOf course, when they left Buster had no intention of disobeying. He\n\nwas satisfied to curl up in a corner of the cabin and sleep until they\n\nreturned; but they were gone for a long time, and late in the afternoon\n\nhe got very restless.\n\n\n\n“I’ll climb up there and look out,” he said to himself, glancing up at\n\nthe window. “They didn’t tell me not to do that.”\n\n\n\nTo reach the window he had to climb up on the stout table, and jump\n\nfrom that to the broad window-sill. This feat wasn’t so difficult, for\n\nBuster had learned to use his claws with great skill in climbing. The\n\njump to the window-sill was a short one, but he nearly missed it, and\n\nhad to scramble desperately to prevent a fall.\n\n\n\nOnce on the window-sill, however, he was well repaid for his trouble.\n\nIt was a beautiful day outside, and the woods smelt so sweet and\n\nattractive that Buster felt a strange longing to get out there and\n\nroll around among the leaves. But he wasn’t going to do it. No, he\n\nremembered the words of his captors, and while he had made no promise\n\nhe intended to obey them.\n\n\n\nJust the same when Groundy the Woodchuck came along and cast a long\n\nshadow in front of the window, Buster leaned so far out that he nearly\n\nlost his balance. Groundy glanced up, and at first was startled and\n\nready to run; but when he saw that Buster was no more than a cub, only\n\na little larger than himself, he stopped and spoke to him.\n\n\n\n“What are you doing up there?” he asked. “You don’t live in that house,\n\ndo you? If you don’t look out the owners will come along and catch\n\nyou.”\n\n\n\n“They’ve caught me already,” replied Buster. “That’s why I’m here,\n\nGroundy.”\n\n\n\n“Oh, then you’re a prisoner!” sighed Groundy. “I’m sorry for you. Are\n\nyou tied by a chain?”\n\n\n\n“Indeed, I’m not! They don’t chain me up. I’m not a prisoner, either.”\n\n\n\nGroundy looked at him in silence, not quite able to understand. Buster\n\nwas grinning at him as if he enjoyed his perplexity. Finally, Groundy\n\nsaid:\n\n\n\n“I can’t believe you, Buster. But there’s one way to show me. If you’re\n\nnot a prisoner, tied by a chain, climb down here. Then I’ll believe\n\nyou.”\n\n\n\n“I can’t--” began Buster, and then stopped. Of course, if he said that\n\nGroundy would go away convinced that he was actually chained inside the\n\nwindow.\n\n\n\n“I thought so,” nodded Groundy. “Well, I’m sorry for you. I must be\n\ngoing now.”\n\n\n\n“Wait a minute!” called Buster. “I’ll climb down just to show you, but\n\nI can’t stay.”\n\n\n\nIt really wouldn’t do any harm, he thought, to climb down and right\n\nback again to show Groundy that he was free. He would do it so quickly\n\nthat he would be back in the cabin again before any one saw him.\n\nGroundy was waiting for him, and Buster couldn’t disappoint him now.\n\n\n\nHe dropped easily to the ground under the window, and cried: “How was\n\nthat for a jump, Groundy! You couldn’t do better, could you?”\n\n\n\n“No, but the thing that puzzles me is, how are you going to get back\n\nagain? Anybody can jump down a hill, but not many can jump up it. Can\n\nyou jump back to the window-sill?”\n\n\n\nBuster had not given much thought to this. He looked up, and the window\n\nwas so high above his head he knew that he could never jump half the\n\nway.\n\n\n\n“I don’t know,” he stammered. “But maybe I can climb back. I’ve got\n\ngood claws, and I can climb a tree.”\n\n\n\n“That may be, Buster, but you can’t climb the side of a house,” replied\n\nGroundy. “If you can I’ll watch you.”\n\n\n\nGroundy squatted down, and Buster anxious to show how well he could\n\nclimb started to go up the side of the house; but a bear hugs a tree\n\nwhen climbing it, and Buster couldn’t get his paws around the cabin any\n\nmore than he could fly to the moon. He made several attempts to dig his\n\nclaws in the logs to pull himself up, but each time he tumbled back to\n\nthe ground before he could reach half way. But he wasn’t going to give\n\nup trying right away, and again and again he made the attempt until\n\ncompletely exhausted.\n\n\n\n“You can’t do it, Buster,” remarked Groundy finally, rising to his\n\nfeet. “I knew you couldn’t. It’s easier to roll down a hill than roll\n\nup it.”\n\n\n\nBuster was greatly disappointed, and he looked around to find something\n\nthat he could roll under the window and climb up that way; but a noise\n\nin the woods suddenly startled Groundy.\n\n\n\n“Someone’s coming,” he whispered. “I must be going. Better come with\n\nme, Buster.”\n\n\n\n“No,” was the reply. “I live here now, and I won’t run away just\n\nbecause I disobeyed and got in trouble.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps it would have been better for him had he accepted Groundy’s\n\ninvitation; but he didn’t know that, and it was to his credit that he\n\nstayed. He knew that he had done wrong in climbing out of the window,\n\nbut two wrongs don’t make a right, and Buster decided that he would\n\nface his masters and let them punish him if they wanted to.\n\n\n\nBut he received a severe shock the next minute. A stranger appeared\n\naround the side of the cabin, and another on the other side. They were\n\nnot pleasant looking. They were very unlike the two men who had rescued\n\nhim from the river.\n\n\n\n“Head him off!” shouted one. “Don’t let him get away!”\n\n\n\nBuster was too surprised and frightened to run, and before he knew it\n\nhe was caught by four stout arms and something thick and blinding was\n\nthrown over his head. He grunted and squealed, but nobody seemed to\n\nhear him. He was picked up and carried swiftly away in the woods and\n\nfor a long time he was jounced and pounded about in a thick blanket\n\nthat completely covered him.\n\n\n\nWhen he finally got a peek of daylight again, he was in a strange\n\nplace, with two evil-looking faces bending over him. In the next story\n\nyou will hear about Buster’s new masters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY VI\n\n\n\nBUSTER’S CRUEL MASTERS\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster was so enraged at the treatment he had received that the moment\n\none of the men touched him he growled and snapped at the hand. He had\n\nnearly suffocated in the blanket, and all the way through the woods he\n\nhad been bounced and jounced around cruelly. His captors had seemed to\n\ntake delight in tormenting him.\n\n\n\nSo you cannot exactly blame him for being very angry when one of the\n\nmen poked him in the ribs with a hand. The hand was quickly withdrawn\n\nthe moment Buster snapped at it.\n\n\n\n“The little beast,” snarled the owner of the hand. “I’ll teach him to\n\nbite!”\n\n\n\nBefore Buster knew what was coming, he was slapped over the head with\n\na stout stick. It stunned him for a moment, and he lay very quiet. But\n\nwhen he got back his senses, he showed his teeth again and sprang for\n\nthe man.\n\n\n\nThis time he was knocked over and kicked about the room until he ached\n\nin every bone. His two captors came for him with short, stout sticks,\n\nwhich they used freely. Again and again Buster sprang at them, and\n\ntried to bite them, but each time he was knocked down.\n\n\n\nYou see, Buster was only a cub, and he was no match for two full grown\n\nmen, but he had the spirit of his wild ancestors in him, and he fought\n\nuntil he was hardly able to stand up. Then he dropped down sullen and\n\nresentful, beaten into silence, but with his spirit still flaming with\n\nanger.\n\n\n\nFrom that day began a new life for Buster. He was no longer treated\n\nkindly and coaxed to do tricks. Every time he failed to do what his\n\ncaptors demanded of him he was kicked and cuffed about, and when he\n\nobeyed them he was not rewarded by any sugar or honey.\n\n\n\nIndeed, he never tasted either of these sweet things. What he had to\n\neat were scraps of bread or meat which the men threw to him after they\n\nhad eaten all they wanted. Instead of having the freedom of a cabin, he\n\nwas kept chained up in a small, dark hut.\n\n\n\nAnd what a hut it was! It was dirty and smelly, with scarcely any sun\n\nor daylight in it. At night time the men lighted a dirty old lamp or a\n\nsmelly candle which spluttered and dripped without giving much light.\n\nHis bed was the bare, hard floor, with nothing for a covering except a\n\nfew whisps of straw.\n\n\n\nBuster rebelled at all this treatment. He couldn’t get used to it. The\n\nmen never spoke a kind word to him, nor ever patted him on the back in\n\na friendly way. They whipped him for the slightest thing, and made him\n\nso afraid of them that finally he ran whenever one of them approached.\n\n\n\nBut even this wasn’t the worst of his captivity. In a short time his\n\ncaptors began to teach him to dance and do tricks, but not in the\n\ngentle way his former friends did. They put a muzzle on his nose so he\n\ncould not bite any one, and tied a chain to his neck. Then with a long\n\npole, one end of which was sharpened, they prodded him into dancing. If\n\nhe didn’t dance fast enough to suit them they jabbed him with the sharp\n\npole, and sometimes when he was so tired he could hardly stand they\n\nmade him stand on his head and turn a somersault.\n\n\n\nAs a reward for all this Buster was given a few dry crusts of bread and\n\na drink of water, but never any honey or sugar. At night time, sore and\n\ntired, he would curl up in the corner of his room, and think of the\n\npast. With tears in his eyes, he thought of his happy home in the cave,\n\nof his mother who was so kind to him, of Loup the Lynx, and of the two\n\nmen who had saved him from the river, and fed him with rich milk and\n\nsugar and honey.\n\n\n\nOh, how he wished he was back with them or at home in the cave with\n\nhis mother! But wishing wouldn’t help him, and after a while he began\n\nplanning a way to escape. He decided to be good, and obey his cruel\n\nmasters, but the first chance he had he would run away from them.\n\n\n\nAfter that Buster became a model bear. He tried to please his masters,\n\nnot because he liked them, but because he was waiting for the chance\n\nto run away. He was really a very bright bear, and within a couple of\n\nmonths he could do many tricks and stunts. He was given a tin cup,\n\nwhich he was taught to hold out to people, and when pennies were placed\n\nin it he bowed and carried them to the man with the pole.\n\n\n\nOne day he was taken out on the streets, and was led along until they\n\ncame to some children playing. One of his masters played a wheezy old\n\norgan, while the other shook the chain and told Buster to dance.\n\n\n\nNow dancing out in the fresh air, with children watching him and\n\nclapping their hands, was very much pleasanter than in his dirty room,\n\nand Buster enjoyed it. He danced as he never did before, and when\n\nthe man holding the chain told him to stand on his head and turn a\n\nsomersault he obeyed promptly.\n\n\n\nThere was a clapping of hands, and a shout of pleasure came from all\n\nsides. Buster got to his feet, bowed, and repeated the performance.\n\nThen a little girl, holding the hand of a gentleman, approached Buster\n\nand handed him a stick of candy.\n\n\n\nIt was time for him to pass the tin cup for pennies, but Buster was so\n\npleased with the little girl’s attention, and so hungry for something\n\nsweet, that he forgot his duties and took the candy. But before he\n\ncould put it in his mouth the man with the chain jerked him back and\n\nprodded him with the sharp pole.\n\n\n\nBuster grunted with pain and hurriedly picked up the tin cup. A shout\n\nof anger went up from the crowd, and the gentleman holding the little\n\ngirl’s hand spoke sharply to Buster’s master. Then he picked up the\n\nstick of candy and handed it to Buster, who took it and tucked it in\n\nhis mouth. How sweet and delicious it tasted! It made him think of the\n\ndays when he was kept in the cabin with the two campers who had rescued\n\nhim from the river.\n\n\n\nOnce more there came a jerk on the chain, and the pole prodded him in\n\nthe side. He had forgotten to pass the tin cup for pennies. The candy\n\nhad made him forget his duties.\n\n\n\nNow it was not Buster’s fault that the crowd didn’t fill his cup with\n\npennies. Indeed, it was because they knew the money was to go to the\n\ntwo men and not to Buster that the people refused to pay.\n\n\n\n“They don’t deserve anything!” somebody said. “They’re cruel to the\n\npoor creature! Don’t give them anything!”\n\n\n\nBuster made a complete circle of the double row of men, women and\n\nchildren, but not a penny was dropped in his cup. When he returned,\n\nfinally, and handed the empty cup to his master he was greeted by an\n\nangry cuff. There was an angry growl from the people, and the men\n\nfearing trouble led Buster away, jerking him hard with the chain.\n\n\n\nBut that wasn’t the last of his punishment. That night when he got home\n\nBuster was sent to bed without even his crust of bread. The men were\n\nangry because he hadn’t collected many pennies for them, and like many\n\nother people in this world they laid all the blame of their failure\n\nupon another. Buster was the scape-goat.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the night, Buster thought of the little girl who had\n\ngiven him the stick of candy, and groaning with pain and hunger he\n\nmade up his mind to run away very soon and find the girl if he had to\n\ntravel half around the world. She would at least be kind to him, and\n\nthat was all he wanted. On the very morrow he would plan a way to get\n\nout of the hut and begin his search for the girl with brown eyes and\n\ndimples in her cheek.\n\n\n\nBuster gets away in the next story, but he joined a circus instead of\n\nfinding the little girl who had been kind to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY VII\n\n\n\nBUSTER MAKES HIS ESCAPE\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster had been growing rapidly all this time, and instead of being\n\na little cub he was nearly as tall as his mother and as broad as a\n\nNewfoundland dog. A few months had made a tremendous difference in his\n\nsize and strength.\n\n\n\nBut he was hardly aware of this change. He still thought of himself as\n\na little bear, but had Loup the Lynx seen him now it is doubtful if he\n\nwould have been so free to attack him. Loup had a wholesome respect for\n\na full grown bear. It was only the young cubs that he liked to tackle\n\nand eat.\n\n\n\nBut if Buster wasn’t aware of his growing size and strength his two\n\ncaptors were. That was why they kept him chained up at night and always\n\ncarried a long pointed pole when they took him out on the street. They\n\nwere afraid that some day Buster would realize his strength, and then\n\nall would be up with their control of him.\n\n\n\nThe day came, however, when Buster suddenly found that his muscles\n\nwere powerful and his strength greater than that of his masters. They\n\nhad been traveling all day from one small town to another, gathering\n\nin a few pennies here and there, and resting by the way-side whenever\n\nopportunity offered. It was a hot day, and the road was dusty and rough.\n\n\n\nWhen they came to a small brook the sight of the cool, sweet water\n\nbrought to Buster’s mind pictures of the broad river that ran in front\n\nof the cave where he was born. A great desire to plunge in the stream\n\nand wallow in the cool water seized him. With this idea in mind he\n\nquickened his pace, and started down the embankment.\n\n\n\nA sudden jerk of the chain around his neck brought him to his senses,\n\nbut with an angry toss of the head he continued on, dragging the man\n\nbehind him. In vain the man tugged at the chain, shouting to his\n\ncompanion, who came up and began prodding Buster with the sharp end of\n\nthe long pole.\n\n\n\nBut Buster wanted to get in the brook. Nothing in all his life had\n\never appealed so much to him. The dust and dirt in his mouth, ears and\n\nnose irritated him. Instead of stopping he slapped at the pole and\n\ncontinued on his way.\n\n\n\nThen something happened that aroused him to fury. The man gave him\n\nsuch a vicious jab with the sharpened pole that it made him grunt and\n\nsqueal. Heretofore such cruel treatment had always cowered Buster, but\n\nit had an opposite effect on him now. It aroused his fury.\n\n\n\nWith a quick, lightening-like stroke he grasped the pole in his two\n\npaws, and before either of his captors could recover from their\n\nsurprise he snapped it in two. It was all done so quickly that even\n\nBuster was surprised.\n\n\n\nSeeing the instrument of his torture lying broken on the ground, Buster\n\nsmiled, and leered at the men. Something in their eyes attracted his\n\nattention. It was fear! Buster read it as clearly as if it had been\n\nprinted there in large letters.\n\n\n\nHis captors were afraid of him! They had lost their pointed pole, and\n\nthus disarmed they were no longer able to torment. Buster was the\n\nmaster of the situation. A great feeling of exultation swelled up in\n\nhim. His eyes gleamed and flashed.\n\n\n\nThen with a roar he turned on the one holding the chain and struck\n\nsavagely at him. What happened filled Buster with glee. The man\n\ndropped the chain and fled with cries of fright. Buster pursued a few\n\nyards, and then sat down on his haunches and laughed.\n\n\n\n“Ho! Ho! They’re afraid of me!” he said. “I won’t have to be their\n\nslave any more! All I’ve got to do is to growl at them, and strike\n\nthem!”\n\n\n\nHe got up and strutted around. He was a free bear once more. Never more\n\nwould he be a captive. He waddled down to the brook and plunged into\n\nthe cool water. He washed and drank and gurgled to his heart’s content.\n\nOnce or twice his captors approached, and tried to coax him out, but he\n\nturned on them with a snarl and made them run away again.\n\n\n\nThen they disappeared entirely, and Buster was left alone to enjoy his\n\nbath. But his freedom wasn’t to last for long, although he didn’t know\n\nit at the time.\n\n\n\nNow as it happened there was a circus in the town a few miles back, and\n\nhis two masters who cared more about the money value of Buster than\n\nanything else, decided that it was a good chance to make a bargain.\n\nThey knew that they would never be able to control their half-grown\n\nbear once he had discovered his strength and power. He was henceforth\n\nuseless for their work.\n\n\n\nBut a circus was different. Buster would be valuable in the circus\n\neither as a trick animal or as a dangerous man-eating creature that had\n\nto be kept caged all the time. People would pay money to view a bear\n\nthat no man could tame. Of course, Buster was no such wild animal, and\n\nhe had no intention of killing any one, but the fact that he had broken\n\naway from captivity and refused to be captured again furnished the\n\nfoundation for a story that he was a wild, desperate animal that could\n\nnot be tamed.\n\n\n\nBuster was lying on the grass near the brook, enjoying a quiet snooze,\n\nwhen he was startled by the appearance of half a dozen men armed with\n\nsticks and pitchforks. He raised his head and looked mildly at them.\n\nBehind walked the two men who had cruelly tormented him.\n\n\n\n“There he is!” shouted one. “Look out for him, or he’ll jump on you!”\n\n\n\nBuster growled when he heard that familiar voice, and rose on his two\n\nhind legs to face the approaching crowd. Some of them stopped and\n\nrefused to go any further; but two or three approached warily. They\n\nwere armed with clubs and pitchforks, but one of them carried a long\n\nrope looped over an arm. Buster didn’t know what this was for, and he\n\nturned his attention to the men with the clubs.\n\n\n\nHe growled and stepped toward them. They retreated a few steps--all\n\nexcept the man with the rope. He seemed cool and unafraid. Buster eyed\n\nhim curiously when he raised an arm and twirled the rope over his head.\n\nHe even watched the rope circle in the air and come toward him.\n\n\n\nIt was not until the rope looped over his head and settled on his\n\nshoulders that he understood; but it was too late then. The man jerked\n\nit, and Buster felt something around his neck that choked him almost\n\nto death. He tore at it with his paws, but before he could rip it off\n\nanother from behind caught him.\n\n\n\nBuster fought fiercely for a few moments, but when the men armed with\n\npointed sticks and clubs ran in and began prodding him sharply every\n\ntime he tore at the rope he began to grow afraid again. He was no match\n\nfor all these men, especially when his neck was being squeezed so that\n\nhe could barely draw a decent breath.\n\n\n\nWhen he quieted down, the men stopped prodding him, and Buster soon\n\nfound that it didn’t pay to fight against such heavy odds. Only when\n\nhis former captors came near him did he growl and show signs of anger.\n\n\n\nBuster was led back a few miles and placed in a cage with iron bars.\n\nThere was plenty of food and water in the cage, and he was glad to get\n\ninside with the ropes off his neck. Buster had joined the circus!\n\n\n\nBut would his new life be happier than the old? Had he jumped from\n\nthe frying-pan into the fire, or were there days ahead when he could\n\nenjoy life once more without the fear of being beaten for every little\n\nmistake? He didn’t know, but he slept soundly and peacefully that night\n\neven if he was a prisoner in an iron cage.\n\n\n\nWhat happened to him in the circus will form part of the next story,\n\ncalled Buster’s First Public Appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY VIII\n\n\n\nBUSTER’S FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cage in which Buster was kept was rather small, but it was clean\n\nand fresh, with plenty of straw on the bottom, and a blanket stretched\n\non one side to shield him from the draft. There were other cages in the\n\nplace, and after the first night he began to get acquainted with their\n\noccupants.\n\n\n\nOn his right there was an old Lion, who had lost most of his teeth and\n\nmuch of his hair. He snored so loudly the first night that Buster was\n\ntwice awakened by what he thought was the roll of thunder. When morning\n\ndawned he asked the Old Lion if he always snored like that.\n\n\n\n“Yes, when I’m asleep, but when I’m awake I snore like this.”\n\n\n\nTo Buster’s surprise he opened his mouth and let out a roar that shook\n\nthe whole place and started every animal crying and snarling. Spot the\n\nLeopard, who was caged on Buster’s left, growled and spit ferociously\n\nas he sprang from one side of his cage to the other. But the Old Lion\n\nsat back on his haunches and roared with laughter.\n\n\n\n“What did you do that for?” asked Buster, when the wild commotion began\n\nto subside.\n\n\n\n“Just to show you how I snore in the day time,” was the retort. “You\n\nwant to hear it again?”\n\n\n\n“No, thank you, once is enough.”\n\n\n\n“Well, if you say so, I won’t,” replied the Old Lion. “But after you’ve\n\nbeen here a long time you’ll be glad to hear me roar. It breaks up the\n\nmonotony. There’s nothing else to do, you know, and it gets dreadfully\n\ntiresome doing nothing. Heigh-o! it’s a dull life!”\n\n\n\nHe yawned and stretched himself. Spot the Leopard on the other side\n\nstopped his snarling, and glanced between his bars at Buster. He was\n\ninterested in this new-comer, and he continued to stare so long that\n\nBuster finally smiled back at him and nodded his head.\n\n\n\n“How did they catch you?” Spot asked suddenly.\n\n\n\n“With a rope,” replied Buster. “I wasn’t expecting it, and they dropped\n\nit over my head before I could run.”\n\n\n\nSpot spit and snarled again to show his temper. “They caught me when I\n\nwas a cub,” he said. “They wouldn’t have caught me if I was full grown.\n\nThey’re afraid of me now. Every time my trainer comes in I snarl and\n\nsnap at her. She snaps the whip in my face, and I pretend to be afraid\n\nof it. But I’m not! I’m just waiting my chance. Some day I’ll pounce on\n\nher, and then--”\n\n\n\nHe swished his long tail and licked his lips, while his eyes glowed\n\nbalefully.\n\n\n\n“What sort of a trainer have you?” asked Buster. “Is she good to you?”\n\n\n\n“There she comes now,” whispered Spot. “You can see for yourself.”\n\n\n\nBuster turned and saw a young woman, dressed in a dazzling, sparkling\n\ncostume of many colors, with a small cap surmounting her golden hair,\n\nand a thick, rawhide whip in her hand. There was a fearless look in the\n\ndark eyes, and when she strode up to Buster’s cage she surveyed him\n\nquite calmly. Buster returned her stare, and blinked two or three times.\n\n\n\n“He doesn’t look so ugly,” the woman said finally, addressing one of\n\nthe attendants. “If I know anything about bears, I should say he was\n\nnaturally good-humored. But of course you can’t tell. His temper may\n\nhave been ruined by some one. His name is Buster, you say?”\n\n\n\nShe walked up to the cage and stuck a hand between the bars and patted\n\nthe shaggy head. “Well, Buster, we’re either going to be friends or\n\nenemies,” she added. “Which is it?”\n\n\n\nBuster couldn’t reply right away, so surprised was he, but\n\nunconsciously he stuck out his tongue and licked the hand. How soft and\n\nvelvety it felt! Instead of drawing the hand away, she permitted him to\n\nlick it again. Then she smiled.\n\n\n\n“You can see,” she said, speaking to the attendant, “he’s answered my\n\nquestion. We’re going to be friends. Now open the door for me. I’m\n\ngoing inside.”\n\n\n\nOnce more Buster was surprised, but not nearly so much as the\n\nattendant. “Don’t do it, Chiquita,” he said in alarm. “He’s not to be\n\ntrusted. He’s a vicious brute.”\n\n\n\nChiquita smiled and put on her gloves.\n\n\n\n“Do I need your advice, Billy,” she said, “when it comes to training\n\nanimals? Now please open the door.”\n\n\n\n“But, Chiquita, you will wait until I summon the attendants to protect\n\nyou if he attacks you.”\n\n\n\n“No, I’m going in now.”\n\n\n\nShe opened the door herself and stepped in the cage. Buster watched\n\nher with eyes of admiration and surprise. He had no fear of her. This\n\ndainty little creature could not hurt him. Indeed, she looked so slight\n\nand helpless that he felt more like protecting her than hurting her.\n\n\n\nShe came up to him and rubbed his nose. He grunted with pleasure. Then\n\nshe patted his head and talked to him in a low, sweet voice. Then she\n\nasked him to get down, and when he obeyed she sat on him. She touseled\n\nhis head, opened his mouth and stuck a hand in it, and finally patted\n\nhim again, and said:\n\n\n\n“He’s all right, Billy, as harmless as a kitten. We’ll put him in the\n\ncircus tonight in place of poor old Bowser.”\n\n\n\nBilly, the attendant, wasn’t convinced of the wisdom of this course,\n\nand shook his head, but Chiquita laughed and walked out of the cage.\n\n\n\nBuster didn’t know just what they meant, for he had never been in a\n\ncircus before, but that evening he learned.\n\n\n\nHe was wheeled into a brilliantly lighted place and stopped alongside\n\nof a big circular cage containing nearly a dozen other animals. There\n\nwas the Old Lion, Spot the Leopard, Boar the Hound, Timber the Wolf,\n\nOcelot the Jungle Cat, and several others which he did not instantly\n\nrecognize.\n\n\n\nHis coming started up a commotion among the animals, for just like\n\npeople they were curious and inquisitive. They eyed him furtively and\n\nsniffed at him. But without noticing them he waddled across the big\n\ncage and took a vacant place near the Old Lion.\n\n\n\nThen something happened that dazzled him. The curtain around the big\n\ncircular cage disappeared, and a sea of human faces were visible on\n\nevery side. The lights went up, and the whole place seemed like a\n\nwonderful picture.\n\n\n\nThe next moment Chiquita entered the cage, holding her whip in one\n\nhand and a flag in the other. She gave a few sharp orders and the\n\nanimals began to pose, dance and run around. It was all new to Buster\n\nand a little confusing, but he tried to follow and imitate the others.\n\nApparently this pleased Chiquita, for she patted him once, and\n\nwhispered in his ear:\n\n\n\n“Well done, Buster! You’re doing splendidly!”\n\n\n\nBuster noticed that Spot the Leopard was often surly and ugly, refusing\n\nto obey until Chiquita hit him with the whip. This made him mind,\n\nbut it didn’t improve his temper any. His surliness made the others\n\nnervous, and once they got all snarled up and confused.\n\n\n\n“You, Spot,” cried Chiquita, “I’ll punish you if you don’t behave. Now\n\ntake that!”\n\n\n\nShe gave him a sharp rap over the nose with her whip. It stung and\n\nenraged Spot, who cowered back a moment, and then crouched for a leap.\n\nChiquita saw what was coming, but she didn’t flinch. She snapped the\n\nwhip in his face again, but this time the trick didn’t work.\n\n\n\nSpot flung himself through the air in a mighty leap, uttering a low\n\nsavage growl, which excited the other animals so they set up a wild\n\nroar. Attendants ran to the cage with long irons and sticks in their\n\nhands, but Chiquita was penned against the iron bars, vainly trying to\n\nhold Spot off at arms’ length. There was a great shout outside, and\n\neverybody stood up, with fear and horror in their eyes.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, Buster suddenly came to life. He\n\nhad taken no part in the commotion, but when he saw Spot attacking\n\nChiquita, whose white face and appealing eyes were turned toward him,\n\nhis anger flared up. He would not stand by idly while the Leopard tore\n\nand scratched the white flesh of his friend.\n\n\n\nWith a low growl, Buster started across the cage, baring his teeth\n\nin an ugly grin, and holding aloft a paw ready to strike. The other\n\nanimals stood aside to let him pass, but Spot was snapping and\n\nsnarling at Chiquita so that he did not see him.\n\n\n\nHow Buster saved Chiquita from Spot the Leopard, and won her undying\n\nfriendship, will be told in the next story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY IX\n\n\n\nBUSTER SAVES CHIQUITA\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot the Leopard had attacked Chiquita so suddenly that she had little\n\nchance of defending herself, and the other animals, excited by the\n\ncommotion, were ready to join in the attack against their fair trainer.\n\n\n\nBuster had not been in the circus long enough to learn the ways of\n\nthe other animals. Chiquita had been kind to him, and after the cruel\n\ntreatment from his former masters it seemed as if the dainty young\n\ntrainer was more than a friend to him. He recalled Spot’s threat to\n\npounce upon Chiquita some day and punish her.\n\n\n\nBuster resolved, as he crossed the cage in a few long strides, to\n\nprotect Chiquita, and if necessary to fight Spot the Leopard. He was\n\nangry with Spot, but not so much as to inflict serious injury on him.\n\nIt was only when he got close and saw the deep scratch on Chiquita’s\n\narm where the Leopard’s claws had laid the flesh open, that his anger\n\nflared up to white heat.\n\n\n\nWith a deeper growl than before, he raised his right paw and delivered\n\na telling blow on Spot’s body. It was not intended as a knock-out blow,\n\nbut Buster had grown to powerful proportions, and his most playful cuff\n\nwas enough to do considerable damage.\n\n\n\nIt landed with a deep thud on Spot’s side, and the Leopard was hurled\n\nto the other side of the cage with a bang. He struck the iron bars, and\n\nfor a moment seemed too stunned or surprised to utter a sound. Buster\n\ncalmly stood in front of Chiquita and glared defiantly at his enemy.\n\n\n\nSpot recovered his senses after a while and let out a growl and screech\n\nthat made every one in the circus shudder. He crouched down low,\n\nswishing his tail, and glaring at Buster. It was a moment of intense\n\nsuspense.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse the other animals kept up their uproar. The fight\n\nhad stirred their blood, and they began crouching and stalking about\n\nthe cage as if anxious to get in the fray. Ocelot the Jungle Cat in\n\nparticular showed great excitement. He began creeping upon Buster from\n\nbehind, and Timber the Wolf sneaked in closer to get a chance.\n\n\n\n[Illustration: HE RAISED HIS RIGHT PAW AND DELIVERED A TELLING BLOW ON\n\nSPOT’S BODY]\n\n\n\nBuster through the corner of his eyes noticed the restless, threatening\n\nmotions of the two. Boar the Hound ran around, barking vigorously,\n\nbut made no attempt to take any part in the fight. The Old Lion, who\n\nwas too sleepy and indolent even to roar, sat apart as if he was to be\n\nthe judge of the contest.\n\n\n\nChiquita, who was slightly wounded, cowered back of her defender,\n\nunable to get her whip or to make her voice heard. A thousand\n\nspectators outside watched with horrified eyes the combat. Attendants\n\nwere running around with long poles and irons to prod the animals back\n\nto their corners, but they were so excited they did little good.\n\n\n\nSuddenly Spot the Leopard took advantage of a moment when Buster was\n\nwatching Ocelot the Jungle Cat. He sprang at his enemy like an arrow\n\nfrom a bow. At the same instant Ocelot closed in, and Timber the Wolf\n\nwatched for his opportunity.\n\n\n\nBut Buster hadn’t been taken off his guard. He had kept one eye on\n\nSpot, and when he shot through the air that powerful right paw of his\n\nwas raised again. It caught Spot in mid-air. It was no gentle blow\n\nthis time. It was delivered with all the force that lay behind those\n\npowerful shoulder muscles.\n\n\n\nIt landed on Spot’s body with such a thud that it could be heard in\n\nevery corner of the great circus. The Leopard was hurled back against\n\nthe iron bars with such force that it seemed for a moment as if they\n\nwould give way. Spot grunted, and dropped to the floor in such a dazed\n\nstate of mind that he couldn’t think or act.\n\n\n\nBuster having delivered this knock-out blow turned swiftly to Ocelot,\n\nwhose claws had sunk into his shaggy leg. The huge paw came down on\n\nOcelot’s head and nearly crushed the skull. He dropped his hold and lay\n\ndown as if suddenly struck by lightning.\n\n\n\nBuster, smarting with the pain in his leg, growled in rage, and turned\n\nto Timber the Wolf. Now Timber was naturally a coward. The punishment\n\nmeted out to Spot and Ocelot immediately caused him to change his mind.\n\nHe ran around the cage as Buster started in pursuit.\n\n\n\nA temper, once it gets beyond control, is a terrible thing to have. It\n\nmay lead into all sorts of trouble. Buster by this time had lost his\n\ncompletely. He was so enraged that he wanted to kill everything in the\n\ncage. His eyes grew blood-shot and terrible to look at.\n\n\n\nHe lunged at Timber, and missed him, but the Old Lion happened to be in\n\nthe way. Buster gave him a side cuff that made him roar with pain. It\n\nwas a glancing blow. If Old Lion hadn’t been so old that most of his\n\nteeth were gone he would have struck back, and Buster would have been\n\nin a peck of trouble. He didn’t know much about lions in those days.\n\n\n\nThe next animal that got in his way was Boar the Hound, which he\n\nsent whimpering across the cage. Then he came to Spot, who was just\n\nrecovering his senses, and with an angry snarl hit him again and stood\n\nbefore him like a cat over a mouse as if defying him to run or strike\n\nback.\n\n\n\nRound and round the cage Buster pursued the animals, striking right and\n\nleft, and tumbling them all in a heap whenever he got within striking\n\ndistance. Ocelot climbed to the top of the iron bars and crouched there\n\nin shivering terror.\n\n\n\nTimber the Wolf leaped and jumped over the backs of the others, and\n\nthus escaped serious injury. It was a mix-up that threatened to end in\n\na terrible tragedy. Buster was master of the situation, and so enraged\n\nthat he continually saw red. The pandemonium outside, and the quickly\n\nthrusting sticks and irons of the attendants, had no effect on his\n\ntemper. He ignored the noise, and merely snapped and snarled at the\n\nsharp irons every time they got in his way.\n\n\n\nThen Chiquita, who had been cowering in her corner in fright, suddenly\n\nregained control of her nerves. She picked up her whip, but did not\n\nuse it. Instead she walked calmly up to the enraged bear, and said\n\nsharply:\n\n\n\n“Buster! Buster!”\n\n\n\nBuster stopped short as if pricked by a needle. When his name was\n\nrepeated in that soft voice, he closed his dripping jaws and ceased\n\ngrowling.\n\n\n\n“Buster, come here!” added Chiquita.\n\n\n\nIt was a soft, soothing command, and it fell on Buster’s excited nerves\n\nlike cooling balm. He looked at Chiquita, and then without so much as a\n\ngrunt waddled toward her.\n\n\n\nWhat followed made every one in the vast audience gasp. Chiquita,\n\nignoring her danger, suddenly put her two arms around Buster’s neck,\n\nand actually wept on his shaggy breast.\n\n\n\n“Buster, you saved my life,” she said gently. “Spot would surely have\n\nkilled me if you hadn’t come to my help. You dear old Buster!”\n\n\n\nBuster’s emotions cannot be described. All his rage suddenly vanished.\n\nHe put a paw on Chiquita’s shoulders, and then fearful of hurting her,\n\ndropped it to his side.\n\n\n\nShe raised her head from his breast, and added: “Now come with me.\n\nTake me outside.”\n\n\n\nAnd leading Buster she walked across the cage, opened the door and\n\nstepped out. Buster meekly followed. Outside she led him by a paw\n\nacross the arena, and faced the great audience. “You have seen what\n\nhappened,” she said in a clear voice. “Can you wonder that I love\n\nBuster the Bear?”\n\n\n\nThe audience went wild, shouting and waving to them, and Buster was so\n\nconfused he hardly knew what to do. In the next story Buster becomes a\n\nfamous trick bear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY X\n\n\n\nBUSTER BECOMES A TRICK BEAR\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster was not popular among the animals of the circus after his fight\n\nwith Spot the Leopard, but he was a great favorite with the circus\n\npeople. From being regarded as a dangerous bear, ready to kill his\n\ntrainer at any moment, he was looked upon thereafter as a special pet\n\nwho could be trusted by every one.\n\n\n\nOf course, it was Chiquita who favored him the most. She bestowed more\n\nattention upon him than on any of the others. She petted him, praised\n\nhim, feeding him dainties, and giving him the softest bed in the place.\n\nShe even permitted him to roam about the rooms she occupied, and as\n\nBuster did not get in mischief or do any harm his liberty was extended\n\nday by day.\n\n\n\nBuster grew as fond of Chiquita as she was of him, and he obeyed her as\n\nmeekly and willingly as a pet dog. None of the ugly temper he showed\n\nwhen fighting Spot in the cage showed itself again, and Chiquita began\n\ntraining him for trick performances.\n\n\n\nBuster had already received a little training, and he was quick to pick\n\nup his new lessons. He soon learned to jump through a hoop, skip rope,\n\nand turn somersaults back and forth. Then one day, Chiquita said:\n\n\n\n“You would make a good clown, Buster, I believe. Yes, you would.”\n\n\n\nNot knowing what a clown was, Buster merely grinned and nodded his\n\nhead. Chiquita made a wonderful dress for him out of red, white and\n\nblue flannel, and with a tall hat on his head Buster looked like the\n\ncartoon of Uncle Sam. Dressed as the goddess of liberty, Chiquita\n\nappeared in the arena walking arm in arm with her escort.\n\n\n\nThis brought great applause from the audience, and what pleased the\n\npeople pleased Buster. He grinned and nodded his head, and strutted\n\naround with his head high in the air.\n\n\n\nAll the time he was receiving special favors and attention, Spot the\n\nLeopard and Ocelot the Jungle Cat were in their cages watching for an\n\nopportunity to get revenge on him. The pain they suffered from Buster’s\n\nhard blows was nothing to what they suffered in mind and spirit. They\n\nwere nearly consumed with rage and envy.\n\n\n\nBuster never passed near the cage without their snarling and spitting\n\nat him. They could do this in safety, for the iron bars were between\n\nthem. Right down in their hearts, however, they were afraid of him.\n\n\n\nBuster, who carried no spirit of ill-feeling against them, merely\n\ngrinned when they spit at him. But one day he stopped in front of\n\nSpot’s cage, and said:\n\n\n\n“Why don’t you forget and forgive, Spot? This carrying a grouch around\n\nwith you all the time spoils your face. Let’s be friends.”\n\n\n\n“Friends!” snarled Spot. “I may think of that after I’ve clawed off\n\nsome of your hide!”\n\n\n\n“Me too!” echoed Ocelot. “And I’d like to begin with your eyes.”\n\n\n\n“And I’ll lap up his warm blood when you’ve killed him,” growled Timber\n\nthe Wolf from his cage.\n\n\n\nBuster, instead of being offended at these threats, sat back on his\n\nhaunches and laughed. Then noticing the Old Lion watching them, his\n\neyes blinking sleepily, he turned to him.\n\n\n\n“What would you like to do to me, Old Lion?” he asked.\n\n\n\n“Nothing, Buster, except to give you some good advice,” was the reply.\n\n\n\n“That’s a friendly offer. I’ll listen to it.”\n\n\n\nThe Old Lion winked and blinked, stretched himself with a yawn, and\n\nthen sat up looking for all the world like the noble king of the beasts.\n\n\n\n“When your enemies threaten you, Buster,” he said slowly, “it is wise\n\nto listen to them so you may be prepared. Don’t let the pride of\n\nstrength deceive you. The mouse gnawed through the net that the lion\n\ncouldn’t break, and Cobra the Reptile put a whole jungle of animals to\n\nflight. That is all, Buster.”\n\n\n\n“Thank you, Old Lion,” replied Buster. “I’ll remember what you said.”\n\n\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference to me whether you remember it or not,”\n\nwas the answer, as the Old Lion stretched out and went to sleep.\n\n\n\nBuster did remember the advice for a few days, and then forgot it. He\n\nalso ignored Spot and Ocelot, for they refused to make friends with\n\nhim. Meanwhile, his progress as a trick bear increased, and he appeared\n\nnightly before big audiences with Chiquita.\n\n\n\nOne day the big tent was taken down, for the circus was to move to\n\nanother town. There was such noise and confusion that every one was\n\nupset. Buster found his customary resting place filled with packing\n\nboxes and baggage. Somewhat put out by this he wandered around,\n\nand finally climbed on the top of a bundle of canvas away from the\n\nconfusion.\n\n\n\nIt was a soft, comfortable bed, and Buster soon fell asleep. He snored\n\nand rolled around in his slumber until attendants came running up to\n\nfind out what the trouble was. When they discovered him, they laughed\n\nand said:\n\n\n\n“It’s only Buster taking his mid-day snooze with the high treble stops\n\nwide open.”\n\n\n\nBuster hadn’t noticed that the pile of canvas was close to the two\n\ncages where Spot and Ocelot were kept. They had kept so quiet that he\n\nnever suspected their nearness. But the Leopard and Jungle Cat had seen\n\nhim, and were watching him with flashing eyes.\n\n\n\nAs he snored and rolled around in his sleep, they kept their eyes\n\npatiently and watchfully on him. Once a shaggy paw came close to Spot’s\n\ncage, and he stealthily put out a fore-arm to see if he could reach it.\n\nHe fell short about an inch.\n\n\n\nHe withdrew his paw silently and resumed his watchful waiting. Ocelot\n\non the other side was equally interested in one of Buster’s fore paws.\n\nIt was within a few feet of his cage.\n\n\n\nBuster rolled over and flung his legs out to their full length like an\n\nanimal stretching. The result was just what the two vengeful enemies\n\nwere waiting for. Spot reached through the bars of his cage and caught\n\nthe hind leg of Buster with his sharp claws, and Ocelot attacked one of\n\nhis fore-legs.\n\n\n\nBuster was aroused from his sleep by sharp pains that seemed like a\n\nthousand needles sticking in him. When he attempted to spring to his\n\nfeet he found himself a prisoner. Spot and Ocelot were tugging, tearing\n\nand biting with all their might as if they would pull him apart and\n\nhaul him through the bars of their cages.\n\n\n\nTaken at such a disadvantage, Buster for a moment was helpless. Then\n\nthe pain became so severe that he brought all of his powerful muscles\n\ninto play, and jerked with such force that both cages came tumbling\n\nover on top of him.\n\n\n\nThe sudden upsetting of their cages startled Spot and Ocelot so that\n\nthey jumped back in fright. Buster was immediately on his feet,\n\nrolling the cages around as if they had been made of jackstraws. With\n\na lightning blow through the bars he struck Spot a whack that sent him\n\nreeling backward. Then before he could recover, Buster sprang around on\n\nthe opposite side and knocked him back. For a moment it looked as if\n\nhe would break through the cage and kill Spot.\n\n\n\nWhen the attendants ran up, Buster was shaking Ocelot’s cage in a\n\nvain endeavor to get at him. The Jungle Cat was so frightened that he\n\nshivered and whined for mercy. Buster’s anger could not be quieted\n\nuntil Chiquita came up. She patted him, and led him away to bind up his\n\nwounds. The Leopard and Jungle Cat were glad to see him go. In trying\n\nto get revenge on Buster they had been punished nearly as much as he.\n\n\n\n“I should have remembered the Old Lion’s advice,” Buster said to\n\nhimself when Chiquita bound up his wounds. Then looking at her, he\n\nadded: “But there’s some good in everything. I wouldn’t have such a\n\ntender nurse if I wasn’t wounded.” And he smiled with satisfaction.\n\n\n\nNext will come the story of how Buster was caught in a railroad wreck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY XI\n\n\n\nBUSTER IN A RAILROAD WRECK\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circus was preparing to move into its winter quarters, and it was\n\nthe confusion of packing that caused Buster to get mixed up with Spot\n\nand Ocelot in their cages. His injuries were very slight, and within a\n\nfew days after Chiquita had bound them up his legs were as good as new.\n\n\n\nHe felt a little angry at the Leopard and Jungle Cat for attacking\n\nhim when fast asleep, but Buster wasn’t the kind to nurse a grudge.\n\nWhen his wrath cooled a little he actually laughed at the occurrence.\n\nStrolling outside to where the cages were standing, he grinned at the\n\nLeopard.\n\n\n\n“You got a good dig at me, Spot,” he said, “but with that last cuff I\n\ngave you I guess we can call it even. Head ache yet?”\n\n\n\nSpot didn’t reply, but paced his narrow cage in restless\n\ndissatisfaction. Buster turned to the Jungle Cat.\n\n\n\n“How about you, Ocelot! Got over your scare yet? I didn’t touch you,\n\nbut you looked as scared as a rat in a trap when I shook your cage.”\n\n\n\nOcelot showed the same silent contempt and refused to reply other than\n\nwith a low snarl. Buster turned to Old Lion.\n\n\n\n“The only cheerful one I find in this group is you, Old Lion,” he\n\nadded. “Spot and Ocelot don’t look happy, and Timber the Wolf acts as\n\nif he had an ingrowing pain in his stomach. How about you?”\n\n\n\n“I’m always cheerful,” replied Old Lion. “That’s why I’ve grown bald\n\nand toothless, and lived to a good old age. Spot and Ocelot will die\n\nyoung if they don’t change their manners. So will you, Buster.”\n\n\n\n“Why,” stammered Buster, “I do try to be cheerful. I didn’t know I was\n\nanything else.”\n\n\n\n“That may be,” replied Old Lion, “but you’re too ready for a fight.\n\nEvery battle you get in shortens your life by so many days.”\n\n\n\n“I don’t fight unless I’m attacked,” was the quick reply.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t know the animals attacked you the other night in the circus.\n\nYou started the fight.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, but not until after they had attacked Chiquita,” Buster said\n\nindignantly. “I had to protect her, for she was a friend of mine.”\n\n\n\n“Are you going to fight to protect all your friends in this world?”\n\nasked Old Lion sleepily. “If you do, I predict you will die young. Now\n\nI must go to sleep, for we begin our long journey soon, and I do hate\n\nriding on a train. It rasps my nerves.”\n\n\n\nBuster never knew how seriously to take the Old Lion’s words, but he\n\nwas a companionable and harmless old fellow, and sometimes rambled on\n\njust to hear himself talk. He was getting so old that talking was the\n\neasiest thing to do, and between eating and sleeping that was about all\n\nhe did. Sometimes he appeared in the circus as a fierce old lion, who\n\nhad killed any number of keepers, but it was growing harder and harder\n\nfor him to assume the pose. He wasn’t fierce looking at all, except\n\nwhen he roared, and that was such an exertion he seldom did it unless\n\nprodded by the attendants.\n\n\n\n“How does it feel to ride on a train?” Buster asked when he saw that\n\nthe Old Lion was going to drop off asleep right before him.\n\n\n\n“How does it feel?” he drawled. “Why, it feels as if all the bones in\n\nyour body were rattling, and when the train stops--and it’s stopping\n\nall the time when it isn’t going--you stand on your head and then on\n\nyour tail, and if you’re lucky you don’t die of fright.”\n\n\n\n“It must be a wonderful experience,” remarked Buster.\n\n\n\n“It is, and you won’t enjoy it. I don’t know what trains were invented\n\nfor unless it was to torture those who ride in them. But when we get\n\nthere we’ll have a long rest.”\n\n\n\n“Where?” asked Buster.\n\n\n\n“Where we’re going, and when you get there you wonder why you came, and\n\nwhere you are. Now do you understand?”\n\n\n\nBuster laughed good-naturedly, for his quizzing was making the Old Lion\n\nirritable. He wanted to sleep and Buster strolled away, leaving him to\n\nenjoy his nap.\n\n\n\nThe next day the animals were taken aboard the train. Some of the\n\nharmless ones were led there and tied to posts in box cars, and others\n\nlike Ocelot and Spot were lifted aboard in their stout cages. No chance\n\ncould be taken with them.\n\n\n\nBuster found himself in a small compartment of a baggage car, with\n\nChiquita occupying a seat just forward of him. She trusted him so much\n\nthat she liked to have him near her. But as he had never been on a\n\nrailroad journey before he was fastened in the car by a chain.\n\n\n\n“You might forget yourself, Buster, or get excited, and try to jump off\n\nwhen the train was moving,” she said to him, when chaining him up. “It\n\nisn’t because I don’t trust you. You understand that, don’t you?”\n\n\n\nBuster nodded his head, as she patted him, and looked at the chain.\n\nIt was not a very strong one, and he smiled at the thought of what he\n\ncould do to it if he wanted to escape. He could snap it in two with one\n\njerk of his powerful body.\n\n\n\nThe train started finally, and Buster was as interested and excited as\n\na child on her first railroad journey. The jolting and rattling began\n\nalmost at once. He recalled Old Lion’s words, and wondered if he was\n\ngroaning in agony. Such rolling and jerking were enough to rattle Old\n\nLion’s teeth loose. And Spot and Ocelot! How did they like the noise\n\nand confusion?\n\n\n\nThe train steamed along slowly at first, and then faster. Through\n\na window in the baggage car Buster could see the houses and trees\n\nflashing past as if they were all running in the opposite direction.\n\nIt was a funny sensation. Instead of being frightened by it, Buster\n\nenjoyed it.\n\n\n\n“I never ran so fast in my life,” he said to himself. “Even Loup the\n\nLynx couldn’t run as fast as this.”\n\n\n\nHe stopped and scowled. He never thought of Loup without growing angry.\n\nThe Lynx had treated him in a cowardly, cruel way, and Buster somehow\n\nwanted to punish him for it. But there seemed little prospect of his\n\never meeting the Lynx again.\n\n\n\n“Oh, well,” Buster sighed, “I can’t spoil my temper thinking of\n\nsomething that happened in the past.”\n\n\n\nStill right down in his heart he had a great desire to go back to the\n\nwoods where he had been born. Perhaps his mother was alive yet, and he\n\nwould dearly like to see her again. How surprised she would be to find\n\nhim grown up, fully as big as she, and far more powerful!\n\n\n\nSuddenly in the midst of these thoughts there came a grinding shriek\n\noutside, and the most fearful of explosions. Buster raised his head to\n\nlisten, and then he was thrown against the opposite side of the baggage\n\ncar with such force that the chain snapped. Everything began to break\n\nand fall down upon him, the whole roof of the car collapsing.\n\n\n\nStunned by the fall, and unable to understand what had happened, Buster\n\nlay there a moment in silence. Everything was quiet after that awful\n\nnoise, but wild shrieks of Ocelot, Spot and other animals soon filled\n\nthe air. Then came the deafening hiss of steam, and shouts and cries\n\nof men.\n\n\n\nWhat had happened! Buster was curious to know what all this noise\n\nmeant, and finding himself loose, with no roof over him, he climbed out\n\nof the wreck. It was dark outside, but there were many lights flashing\n\naround.\n\n\n\nBuster walked down the track where a group of men were at work. They\n\npaid no attention to him, and he sat down to wait. Chiquita would come\n\nalong soon to claim him. But he waited and waited, and nobody paid any\n\nattention to him. Finally, he got up and wandered off in the fields,\n\nand before he stopped he was lost and couldn’t find his way back again.\n\n\n\n“I think I’ll sleep here until morning,” he said, seeking a good\n\nresting place under a tree. “Then I’ll find my way back to the train.”\n\n\n\nBut it wasn’t the train he found. It was the little girl who had given\n\nhim candy that day he danced for pennies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY XII\n\n\n\nBUSTER MEETS THE LITTLE GIRL AGAIN\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Buster woke the next morning the sun was just peeping above the\n\ntrees. He had slept so soundly that he couldn’t recall right away all\n\nthat had happened the previous night. He opened his eyes, and was\n\nsurprised when he found that nothing around him was familiar.\n\n\n\nHe grunted and rose to his feet, blinking at the sun. Then it all\n\nreturned to him. He remembered the jolt and crash, and the splintering\n\nof the roof of his car. He rubbed his head to see if the bruise still\n\nhurt him, and winced when it pained him.\n\n\n\n“I wonder what happened to the Old Lion,” he said, grinning. “He must\n\nhave lost all his teeth last night.”\n\n\n\nThen he thought of Chiquita. If she was in the wreck, too, she may have\n\nlost something more than her teeth. Suppose she had lost her life! This\n\nthought grieved Buster.\n\n\n\n“I must go back and find out,” he said. “She’ll miss me.”\n\n\n\nHe waddled away through the bushes until he came to a road that was\n\nunfamiliar to him. Which way did he go to reach the railroad? He\n\nstarted up it, but hadn’t gone far before he saw a man approaching,\n\ncarrying a basket on his arm. Buster was less alarmed than the man\n\napparently, for with a shriek of terror the latter dropped his basket\n\nand ran up the road so fast that he was soon out of sight.\n\n\n\n“What a foolish thing to do,” laughed Buster. “He must have had an evil\n\nconscience or he wouldn’t be frightened like that.”\n\n\n\nHe waddled up to the basket the man had dropped. One sniff at its\n\ncontents made his heart jump with joy. It was filled with nice fresh\n\nbread, rolls, and two blackberry pies.\n\n\n\nBuster didn’t consider it stealing. The man had left the basket, and it\n\nbelonged to any one who found it. He was very hungry, but bear-like or\n\nboy-like (I don’t know which to call it) he began with the blackberry\n\npies instead of the bread. He ate them up rapidly, stuffing them in his\n\nmouth with both paws. When they were gone he looked through the basket\n\nfor more.\n\n\n\nThe bread didn’t taste nearly so good after the pies, but Buster was\n\nstill very hungry, and, not finding any more dessert, he began slowly\n\nmunching the bread. If there had been soup, I suppose, he would have\n\nended his meal with that.\n\n\n\nAfter eating a dozen rolls, and one loaf of bread, he felt better. A\n\nnoise up the street, accompanied by loud shouting, suddenly made him\n\nstop and listen. Perhaps the man who owned the basket was returning\n\nwith help.\n\n\n\nBuster decided that he wouldn’t wait until the men appeared, and taking\n\na loaf of bread in each of his front paws he climbed over the fence\n\nand disappeared in the woods. Long before the men reached the spot he\n\nhad made his way into the heart of a big swamp where he sat down and\n\nfinished his meal.\n\n\n\nHe felt so much better by that time that he took a long drink from the\n\nbrook, and then resumed his journey. He came out of the swamp on the\n\nopposite side, and seeing a hill climbed to the top. He hoped to get a\n\nview of the railroad from there.\n\n\n\nBut when he reached it he saw no signs of it. There was a small cluster\n\nof houses on his right, a swamp and woods behind him, and open country\n\non his left, with here and there a farm house. Buster decided to keep\n\naway from the village.\n\n\n\nThe farm houses attracted him, for he could hear the crowing of a\n\nrooster off in that direction and the cackling of geese. There was the\n\nmoo of a cow and the neighing of a horse from one barn-yard, and the\n\nbarking of a dog from another.\n\n\n\n“I won’t bother the dog,” Buster said, keeping away from that\n\nfarm-yard. “They’re harmless, but very annoying.”\n\n\n\nHe waddled across a field and climbed a fence until he stood in the\n\nbarn-yard of the nearest farm. After reaching the barn he poked his\n\nhead in the open doorway. A boy was in there milking a cow. Buster\n\nwatched the streams of milk, and a sudden desire to taste milk again\n\nmade him forget all caution. He stepped across the threshold, a\n\npleasant grin on his face, and a rollicking smile in his eyes.\n\n\n\nBut the boy didn’t see anything friendly in either the grin or the\n\ntwinkling eyes. When he glanced up and caught sight of Buster, he sat\n\non his milk stool as if paralyzed, and then recovering himself he let\n\nout a shrill cry and darted for the opposite door. He disappeared like\n\na flash, leaving the milk pail behind him.\n\n\n\n“How foolish of him!” said Buster. “I wouldn’t hurt him!”\n\n\n\nHe picked up the milk pail and held it to his lips. There was a gurgle,\n\ngurgle as the milk ran down his throat, and it never stopped until\n\nthree whole quarts were emptied in his stomach.\n\n\n\n“That makes me feel better,” he said, rubbing his fat stomach. “I’m so\n\nfull now I can hardly walk. I’m sleepy, too.”\n\n\n\nThe hay-mow overhead attracted him. How pleasant it would be to rest\n\nand sleep there! He was going to climb up the ladder for this purpose\n\nwhen a great noise outside alarmed him. He peeked out, and saw a\n\nbig crowd of men and boys armed with sticks, axes, pitchforks and\n\nshot-guns, running toward the barn.\n\n\n\nBuster decided to leave, for he had no desire to meet the crowd.\n\nWhile his enemies came in the front door, Buster ran out of the back\n\none, crossed an orchard, and reached a field beyond before he was\n\ndiscovered. He had a long start of them, but when they caught sight of\n\nhim again they began to blaze away with their shot-guns.\n\n\n\nBuster was an excellent runner, and he made good time. Ahead of him was\n\na bigger house, with a wide lawn in front, and a garden in back. Buster\n\nwasn’t going to enter this place, but another crowd of men appeared in\n\nfront of him. If he kept on he would run right into their arms.\n\n\n\nBuster darted to the right, crossed the lawn and reached the back of\n\nthe house. There was no one around, and Buster hunted for a hiding\n\nplace. There was an open window over his head on the second story of\n\nthe house, and a low shed leading up to it.\n\n\n\nBuster suddenly decided that was his best hiding place, and up the shed\n\nhe climbed, scrambling to the roof and crawling across this to the open\n\nwindow. He looked inside, and seeing no one he entered.\n\n\n\nHe was breathing hard, for after eating so much, his exertions told on\n\nhim. This noise must have awakened the little sleeper on the bed, for\n\nsuddenly she rose up and startled Buster so that he nearly fell down in\n\na faint. He supposed the room was empty, and here was a young person\n\nstaring at him. He stared back, grinning foolishly. He felt very much\n\nlike a boy who had been caught stealing.\n\n\n\nThen to his surprise the girl clapped her hands, and said: “Oh, I\n\nbelieve you’re Buster! Yes, I know you are! And I’m so glad!”\n\n\n\nUntil then Buster hadn’t recognized the little person. Now he\n\nremembered her. It was the little girl who had offered him a stick of\n\ncandy that day he danced for pennies on the street.\n\n\n\nBut what pleased Buster more than anything else was her joy. She wasn’t\n\na bit afraid of him! She wasn’t going to run away and scream for help.\n\nShe wouldn’t hand him over to the men pursuing him with shot-guns. What\n\na relief to him this was! She was surely his friend, and would protect\n\nhim just as Chiquita had done so many times. He grinned with pleasure,\n\nand waddled toward the bed.\n\n\n\nHow the little girl outwitted the men, and saved Buster from them, will\n\nbe told in the next story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY XIII\n\n\n\nBUSTER AND THE LITTLE GIRL\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of showing fear when Buster approached the bed, the little\n\ngirl held out a hand, and when he was near enough she took one of his\n\nshaggy paws and patted it. This seemed natural enough to Buster, for he\n\ncould not understand why any one should be afraid of him, and Chiquita\n\nhad done the same thing many times; but to most little girls perhaps\n\nit would seem like a brave and fearless thing. This little girl like\n\nLittle Red Riding-Hood was not afraid of bears or wolves until they\n\ntried to eat her up.\n\n\n\n“I’m glad to see you, Buster,” she said with quaint gravity. “But how\n\ndid you ever get here?”\n\n\n\nBuster grinned and turned his head toward the open window. The little\n\ngirl followed his gaze, and instantly understood.\n\n\n\n“Oh, you came through the window,” she added. “That makes it so much\n\nmore interesting. Fairies and elves always come through open windows.\n\nWon’t you sit down?”\n\n\n\nBuster was quite tired after his hard run, and was very glad to accept\n\nthis invitation. The foot of the bed seemed a very inviting seat, and\n\nhe sat on the white coverlet.\n\n\n\nBut almost immediately he sprang up in alarm. The springs creaked under\n\nhis great weight, and for a moment it looked as if the whole bed would\n\ncollapse. He jumped to his feet with a queer expression on his face. In\n\nfact, he wasn’t sure but this was some sort of a trap set for him.\n\n\n\nBut the little girl laughed merrily at the accident, and clapped both\n\nhands. He could not believe she was attempting to deceive him, and he\n\ngrinned like a foolish boy who had discovered a bent pin in his chair.\n\n\n\n“Oh, Buster,” she cried, “I guess this isn’t a _bear_-bed. You’re too\n\nheavy for it. Maybe the chair will hold you.”\n\n\n\nBuster turned and looked at the chair. He seemed a little doubtful,\n\nbut he wanted to be polite. He tried it carefully, but when it began\n\nto crack and groan under his weight he was wise enough not to go any\n\nfurther. He shook his head, and put the chair back in its place.\n\n\n\n[Illustration: HE DIDN’T MIND THE FLOOR AS A SEAT]\n\n\n\nThe little girl shrieked with laughter again. It was very amusing to\n\nher, and Buster, not wishing to offend her, grinned and nodded his\n\nhead. He liked children, and this one was anxious to play with him.\n\nAfter a while she grew serious again, and looked around at every\n\narticle in the room.\n\n\n\n“I don’t know, Buster,” she said slowly, “but you’ll have to sit on the\n\nfloor. I don’t think anything else is strong enough to hold you. It’s\n\nnot very polite to ask visitors to sit on the floor, but what else can\n\nI do, unless you prefer to stand?”\n\n\n\nBuster didn’t prefer to stand. He was very tired, and he didn’t mind\n\nthe floor as a seat at all. In fact, it was more suitable to him than\n\na bed or chair. So he squatted down on his haunches, and smiled. Even\n\nthen his head towered above the little girl’s.\n\n\n\n“Are you comfortable there?” she asked.\n\n\n\nBuster nodded. “Then,” she added, “you must tell me where you came\n\nfrom, and how you escaped those cruel men. I want to hear the whole\n\nstory. It’s better than a story from a book, and I love story books\n\nabout bears. Did you ever hear the story of Goldy Locks or the Three\n\nLittle Bears? No. Then I’ll tell you.”\n\n\n\nBut she didn’t have time. Just then there was a great commotion\n\noutside. Men were shouting and calling, dogs barking, and a great\n\nhullabaloo going on under the open window.\n\n\n\n“What’s that!” exclaimed the little girl, hopping out of the bed, and\n\nrunning to the window in her bare feet.\n\n\n\nBuster could have told her what the noise meant, and for a moment he\n\nthought it was his duty to give himself up to keep the little girl from\n\nbeing harmed. Suppose the crowd searching for him should hurt her! He\n\ngot up, and tried to pull her away from the window, but she pushed him\n\nback quickly.\n\n\n\n“Go back, Buster!” she cried. “They’re looking for you, but they won’t\n\nhave you. They mustn’t see you!”\n\n\n\nThe dogs below were barking. They had tracked Buster to the woodshed,\n\nand were now holding their nose up in the air baying loudly. As plain\n\nas words they were saying the bear had climbed to the roof of the shed.\n\n\n\nThe men saw the open window, and immediately a hoarse cry rose. “He’s\n\ngone in that window! He’s eating up little Nell! Oh! Oh!”\n\n\n\nYou could imagine Buster’s emotions when he heard this outcry. To be\n\naccused of eating up little Nell was enough to make any self-respecting\n\nbear angry. He growled savagely, and started for the window again. But\n\nthe little girl restrained him once more.\n\n\n\n“No, no, Buster, you mustn’t let them see you!” she cried. “Now let me\n\nthink! What ought I to do? They’ll be here soon. Yes,” glancing out of\n\nthe window, “they’re climbing up the shed. Oh, Buster, hide under the\n\nbed!”\n\n\n\nBuster obeyed, but he might just as well have tried to crawl through\n\nthe key-hole of the lock on the door. He couldn’t possibly squeeze\n\nunder the bed without upsetting it.\n\n\n\n“Dear me,” added Nell, biting her lips, “where can I hide you?”\n\n\n\nShe looked at the closet filled with her pretty clothes. She ran to it\n\nand looked in. It was such a small closet that Buster couldn’t possibly\n\ncrowd in it.\n\n\n\n“I don’t know, Buster,” she added, “what I can do.” She looked at her\n\ntrunk. No, of course, not; she couldn’t get Buster in that. The bureau\n\nnext, and then the wash-stand. Not one of them was big enough to hold\n\none of Buster’s hind legs.\n\n\n\nThey could hear the men climbing to the roof of the shed now. In a few\n\nmoments they would appear at the open window with their shot-guns and\n\npitchforks. The little girl was more excited than Buster. Suddenly an\n\nidea came to her, and she gasped with delight.\n\n\n\n“Here, Buster,” she called sharply, seizing him by a paw. “You must lie\n\ndown on the floor at the foot of the bed. Get way down! No, no, not\n\nthat way! This way! Pull your legs up like a cat cuddling up before the\n\nfire. There, that’s right. Now don’t you move or make a sound. You hear\n\nme?”\n\n\n\nShe shook a finger warningly at him. She had made Buster curl up on the\n\nfloor at the foot of the bed in the smallest space he had ever before\n\noccupied. It was not a comfortable position for him, but for the little\n\ngirl’s sake he was satisfied to stay there.\n\n\n\nThen Nell pulled the clothes down, and threw them over the foot-board\n\nof the bed and spread them out on the floor until Buster was completely\n\ncovered. She laid the pillows on top just as if they had been put there\n\nto air. She had been taught to do this every morning after rising, and\n\nthen open the window for the fresh air to blow in.\n\n\n\nThe men appeared at the window just as she had finished. Without\n\nwaiting for an invitation they climbed in.\n\n\n\n“Where is he?” they asked. “Where’s the bear? We thought he was in here\n\neating you up, Nell.”\n\n\n\nThey were glancing all around the room, and if Buster hadn’t been so\n\nwell concealed they would have seen him. Nell turned to them with\n\ndignity, and said in her high little voice:\n\n\n\n“What an idea! Is there a bear around here? Oh, I’d dearly like to see\n\nhim! I know he wouldn’t hurt me! Where did he come from? Is he outside?”\n\n\n\nShe ran to the window and looked out. Satisfied now that Buster was\n\nnot in the room, the men climbed out, but they closed the window after\n\nthem, and said: “Keep that shut, Nell!”\n\n\n\nIn the next story Buster is discovered in the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY XIV\n\n\n\nBUSTER TRIES TO ESCAPE AND IS DISCOVERED\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the men left the room and closed the window after them, Buster and\n\nthe little girl felt greatly relieved. Satisfied that the bear had not\n\nclimbed in the open window, the searching party turned their attention\n\nelsewhere. But the danger wasn’t over yet, and Nell knew it. She patted\n\nthe top of the bed-clothes, and whispered:\n\n\n\n“Keep quiet a little longer, Buster. Here comes some one up the stairs.”\n\n\n\nBuster grunted and lay as still as a mouse. There was a knocking on the\n\ndoor, and when the little girl opened it her father appeared. He was\n\nvery white and trembling.\n\n\n\n“A bear that escaped from the railroad wreck is roaming around here,\n\nNell,” he said. “I was terribly afraid he had climbed up the shed to\n\nyour room. I’m so glad you’re safe.”\n\n\n\nHe kissed her and seemed greatly relieved to find his daughter safe. He\n\ncrossed the room and looked out of the window. Then he returned to her.\n\n\n\n“Perhaps you’re safer here until they find him,” he added. “Stay right\n\nhere in your room, and keep the door and window locked. I’ll come and\n\ntell you when they find him.”\n\n\n\nThe little girl could have laughed in her glee, for this was just what\n\nshe wanted. She was terribly afraid Buster would smother under all\n\nthose clothes and make a noise. She couldn’t get her father out of the\n\nroom quick enough.\n\n\n\nWhen he was gone, and the door locked, she ran to the bed, and threw\n\nback the clothes. Buster was all curled up just as she had left him.\n\nBut he was fast asleep! It was a warm, comfortable bed, and after his\n\nlong run and heavy breakfast of pies, rolls, bread and milk it had\n\nseemed impossible to keep his eyes open for long. And the moment he\n\nclosed them he was sound asleep.\n\n\n\nThe little girl sat down on the floor, and laughed until the tears\n\nstreamed down her cheeks. Buster woke with a start and blinked at her.\n\nHe couldn’t for several minutes imagine where he was.\n\n\n\n“Oh, Buster,” she exclaimed finally, “I thought you were being\n\nsmothered to death, and you were so comfortable you fell asleep.”\n\n\n\nBuster struggled to his feet and began chuckling. It made him happy to\n\nsee the merriment of the little girl. She pulled the clothes up and\n\nflung them back on the bed. She was a very prim little housekeeper, for\n\nshe was not satisfied until the pillows were brushed off and patted in\n\nposition and the sheets and covers carefully smoothed out.\n\n\n\nBuster watched her in silence, and then in his clumsy way offered to\n\nhelp, but he pulled the clothes so hard, and made such a general mess\n\nof it, that he stopped when the girl sat down and laughed again at him.\n\n\n\n“I never saw anybody so clumsy, Buster,” she said. “No, you can’t help\n\nany more. You sit down there in the middle of the floor until I’m\n\nthrough. Then we’ll have breakfast together.”\n\n\n\nThe moment she uttered these words she stopped. Have breakfast\n\ntogether? How could she arrange that? How, in fact, could she manage to\n\nget Buster any breakfast without somebody discovering him in her room?\n\n\n\nWhat did bears eat anyway? And how much? Goodness, from the size of\n\nhim, he might eat her father out of house and home! The little girl\n\nfelt terribly distressed all of a sudden. She had saved Buster from his\n\npursuers, but now that she had him what was she going to do with him?\n\n\n\nYou couldn’t keep bears in a bed-room or closet, nor could you chain\n\nthem up in the back yard like a dog? Everybody would be afraid to visit\n\nthe house, and all the servants would leave. What could she do?\n\n\n\n“Buster, haven’t you any home you can go to?” she asked suddenly,\n\nturning to him. Then she remembered what her father had told her. The\n\ntrain carrying the circus animals had been wrecked, and some of the\n\npeople and animals killed. Of course, the circus people would like\n\nBuster back again, but was he happy there? Or did he run away because\n\nthey treated him cruelly?\n\n\n\n“Buster, do you want to go back to the circus?” she added after a\n\npause. “For if you do I’ll have to tell them you’re here, and if they\n\nwant you they’ll call for you.”\n\n\n\nNow Buster had no desire just then to return to the circus. He thought\n\nit would be much nicer to live with the little girl and play with her.\n\nSo he shook his head vigorously, which made the girl sigh, and say\n\nsolemnly: “Then you won’t have to go back! I’ll keep you here!”\n\n\n\nShe cleaned up things in the room, and dressed herself. Her breakfast\n\nwas waiting for her downstairs, and if she didn’t go soon her father\n\nwould be up after her.\n\n\n\n“Buster,” she said once more, laying a hand on his head, “I’m going\n\ndown now to get my breakfast, and then I’ll bring you something to\n\neat--some sugar and coffee, and jam and--and--what do you like to eat?”\n\n\n\nBuster only grinned and shook his head. The little girl was puzzled. “I\n\nknow what I’ll do,” she added, smiling. “I’ll ask my father. He’s wise\n\nand knows everything, and he’ll tell me what bears eat. I know he’ll\n\nlike you, Buster.”\n\n\n\nOf course, Buster wasn’t quite so sure of this, but he had no way to\n\nexpress his doubts. He heard the little girl running down the stairs,\n\nand then for a long time he was left alone. It was a queer situation\n\nfor him. He walked across the room, and the floor squeaked with every\n\ntread. Then he looked out of the window and immediately ducked his\n\nhead, for there was a man and dog below on guard.\n\n\n\nHe waited a long time for the little girl to return, and then grew\n\nrestless. He tried the door, and finding it unlocked opened it and\n\nstuck his head out. All was quiet in the house. He couldn’t hear any\n\none around.\n\n\n\nA great fear that something had happened to the little girl suddenly\n\nmade him very anxious. Perhaps the men and dogs had captured her, and\n\nwere holding her because she had hid him in her bed-room. This thought\n\nmade him angry. If she was in trouble and needed him, he would go to\n\nher assistance.\n\n\n\nBuster closed the door softly behind him and started down the stairs.\n\nNow that he was going to the little girl’s assistance he wasn’t afraid\n\nof anything. He hadn’t been afraid to attack all the animals in the big\n\ncage when Chiquita was in danger. Then why should he be afraid now!\n\n\n\nDown, down the stairs he clumped, his great weight making each step\n\nsqueak and groan. Nobody was in the hall below, and the whole house\n\nseemed quiet and deserted. Had the men taken the little girl away with\n\nthem? Buster uttered an angry growl and took another step down.\n\n\n\nThen directly in front of him appeared a man. He stepped out of a\n\ndoorway so suddenly that both bear and man were surprised. Buster\n\nrecognized him immediately as the gentleman who held the little girl’s\n\nhands that day she fed him a stick of candy.\n\n\n\nThe man started suddenly, stared at the bear on the stairs, and backed\n\nslowly away. “Nell! Nell!” he called. “Keep away! Go back! The bear is\n\nin the house! Run for your life and tell the men!”\n\n\n\nBut little Nell, instead of running away, pushed past her father and\n\nsurprised him so that he nearly dropped down with fright. She ran\n\nstraight up to Buster and hugged him. Then laughing she turned to her\n\nfather.\n\n\n\n“It’s only Buster, and he wouldn’t hurt me. Why, he’s been in my\n\nbed-room all the time!”\n\n\n\nWhat they decided to do with Buster after that will be told in the next\n\nstory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY XV\n\n\n\nBUSTER IS TO BE SENT TO THE ZOO\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seemed almost like a fairy story to the little girl’s father when\n\nshe told him how Buster had climbed through the window of her room, and\n\nhow she had covered him up with the bed-clothes to protect him from the\n\nmen. And he didn’t believe in fairy stories! In fact, he didn’t believe\n\njust then that he was awake and hearing things. It surely was all a\n\ndream.\n\n\n\nBut there was Buster on the stairs, and his little girl hugging the\n\ngreat big, shaggy creature. Why, with one blow the bear could crush\n\nthe life out of her! It made him tremble to think of it. He tried to\n\ncall her away, but she didn’t hear him. She was talking to Buster, who\n\nseemed to understand.\n\n\n\n“Now, papa, you see he won’t hurt me,” she said finally, “and I won’t\n\nlet the men hurt him. We must do something for him.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, yes, dear,” was the stammering reply. “But what?”\n\n\n\n“Can’t we keep him here?”\n\n\n\nThe man smiled for the first time. “Where----in your bed-room?”\n\n\n\n“No-o, but maybe outdoors. I think he likes outdoors the best.”\n\n\n\n“But, dear, he would never be happy here, and he’d frighten all of our\n\nneighbors. He may be good to you, but he might be ugly to others.”\n\n\n\n“Not if they were kind to him,” was the confident answer.\n\n\n\n“Maybe not! Maybe not! But we must think of it.”\n\n\n\nHe was quiet for a moment, watching Buster out of the corner of his\n\neyes. He was less afraid of the bear than at first. Something in his\n\neyes made him think that perhaps his little girl’s trust was not\n\nmisplaced after all. But he had a natural fear of all wild animals, and\n\ndid not like to run any risks.\n\n\n\n“I’ll tell you, dear,” he added finally, “we’ll put Buster in the\n\ncellar until the men have gone, and then--then we’ll telegraph to the\n\nowners of the circus. They will come for him, and he’ll be better off\n\nwith them than with us.”\n\n\n\n“But maybe he ran away from the circus because they were cruel to him,”\n\nprotested Nell. “I don’t want him to go back then.”\n\n\n\n“I don’t know about that, but I read in the papers that the circus\n\npeople are going out of business. Their loss of animals in the smash-up\n\ndecided them to give up the show business. Chiquita, their famous\n\ntrainer, was injured so she’ll never go back to performing again. I\n\nbelieve she’s in the hospital now, and won’t be out for a month or two.”\n\n\n\nNow all this was news to Buster. They couldn’t understand how eager\n\nhe was to learn all about the circus. If Chiquita was injured in the\n\nwreck, then perhaps Spot and Ocelot and Old Lion were hurt, too, or\n\neven dead.\n\n\n\nIt made him very sad, for it meant the end of his circus life. He would\n\nnever want to perform for another trainer now that Chiquita was gone.\n\nPoor Chiquita! Buster shed a tear for her, for she had been his dear\n\nfriend, and he knew now that he couldn’t help her or ever see her again.\n\n\n\n“Then, papa,” broke in little Nell again, “we can keep Buster, can’t\n\nwe?”\n\n\n\n“Only a few days, dear,” was the smiling reply. “We have no place to\n\nkeep him, and I’m sure he’d soon try to escape.”\n\n\n\nThe little girl pouted, and looked anxiously at Buster before speaking.\n\n“Then what will become of him?” she added. “He won’t have any home at\n\nall. That will be dreadful, papa, and he’s been so good to me.”\n\n\n\n“Ah!” exclaimed her father suddenly, his eyes brightening. “I have it.\n\nWe’ll send him to the Zoo. We’ll make them a present of him if the\n\ncircus people don’t come to claim him.”\n\n\n\nThe little girl was not exactly sure that she approved of this, and she\n\ncontinued pouting and looking at Buster. “But won’t they shut him up in\n\na cage, and keep him there all the time?” she queried. “I don’t think\n\nI’d like to be caged forever and forever, would you?”\n\n\n\nThe question was addressed to her father, but Buster answered it with a\n\nvigorous shake of the head. He didn’t know anything about the Zoo. It\n\nwas a place he had never heard about, but if they kept bears caged up\n\nthere all the time he didn’t care to know more about it. It certainly\n\nwas a dreadful place.\n\n\n\nHe had often pitied Spot and Ocelot for being shut up in their cages\n\nall the time, but he blamed them a good deal for that. They wouldn’t\n\nbehave themselves decently, and it served them right. But that was no\n\nreason why he should be kept in a cage all the rest of his life. No, he\n\npreferred to be free.\n\n\n\n“My dear,” Buster heard the father say after a pause, “that is the only\n\nwise thing to do. Keeping him here is simply out of the question. We\n\nmust put him in the cellar until I can notify the authorities. Then\n\nthey’ll put him in a cage at the Zoo, and you can go and see him as\n\noften as you like.”\n\n\n\nThe thought of being able to see Buster at the Zoo made her feel\n\nbetter, and she turned and whispered to him: “I’ll come every week to\n\nsee you, Buster, and I’ll bring you sugar and peanuts and candy, and\n\neverything.”\n\n\n\nBuster smiled, for he knew that she meant what she said, but he was\n\ngreatly troubled in mind. Could he, for the sake of seeing the little\n\ngirl once a week, endure prison for the rest of his life? All the\n\noutdoor freedom would then be denied him. He couldn’t walk around, nor\n\nperform before people in the circus; he couldn’t even crawl under a\n\npile of canvas or a clump of bushes to sleep. He would always be behind\n\nthose iron bars.\n\n\n\nHe remembered how Old Lion had complained of the monotony of life in\n\nthe cage, and Old Lion had grown old and weak in doing nothing. Spot,\n\nOcelot and Timber had never become reconciled to their captivity, but\n\npaced their cages day and night longing to escape.\n\n\n\nBuster drew a great sigh, and glanced out of the window. He saw green\n\ntrees, smiling fields and tinkling brook. Ah, how he loved those! No,\n\nhe could not leave them forever. He started for the outside door as if\n\nto leave the house.\n\n\n\n“Don’t let him out, Nell,” the little girl’s father said. “The men and\n\ndogs are out there. Do you think you can get him down the cellar for\n\nthe night?”\n\n\n\n“Yes, papa, he’ll come with me,” was the answer. “Won’t you, Buster?”\n\n\n\nBuster nodded, and followed her. He had no wish to go outside and fall\n\nin the hands of his pursuers. So he meekly followed the little girl\n\ndown the stairs to the cellar where he was safe from all his enemies.\n\nIt was a wide, roomy cellar, and Buster felt quite content there, but\n\nthe thought that the men might call for him on the morrow to take him\n\naway to the Zoo spoilt his happiness.\n\n\n\nWhen the little girl left him, he had made up his mind. Before morning\n\nhe would break out of the cellar and escape. There had come into his\n\nmind a vision of the woods where he had been born, and a great desire\n\nto find his way back. Could he do it? In the next story you will hear\n\nhow he set out on his long journey, and what happened to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORY XVI\n\n\n\nBUSTER RETURNS TO THE NORTH WOODS\n\n\n\n\n\nBuster spent the rest of the day in the cellar of the house where the\n\nlittle girl lived, sleeping part of the time and playing with his\n\nlittle friend whenever she had the time to come down. There were many\n\nthings in the cellar that smelt good--jams and jellies stored away in\n\na closet, potatoes, apples and cabbages in bins, and boxes full of\n\ndry groceries--but Buster did not touch any of these. He ate what the\n\nlittle girl fed him, and nothing else.\n\n\n\nAs the day dragged along, and night approached, he thought more and\n\nmore of the North Woods where he had been born. He saw the beautiful\n\nriver that flowed past the cave, heard the tinkling of the waves and\n\nthe songs of the birds, and sniffed the fragrance of the millions of\n\nwild flowers. He thought of his mother, who had mourned his death--of\n\nLoup the Lynx, who had driven him from home, and made him an exile.\n\n\n\nAnd the more he thought of these things, the more anxious he was to\n\nreturn to the woods. He was not needed in the circus now. Chiquita had\n\ngone, and he would never find another trainer like her. The little girl\n\nwas his friend and loved him, but he could have no home with her. Then\n\nthe place for him was in the woods where he would be free to roam about\n\nand hunt as he chose.\n\n\n\nIt was nearly dark when the little girl said good-night to him. She\n\nkissed him on the tip of the nose, and Buster felt a desire to take her\n\nin his arms and hug her. But he knew that would never do. His gentlest\n\nhug might break her little bones and kill her. So he contented himself\n\nwith a smile and grin, and waved a paw to her as she closed the door.\n\n\n\nBuster ate the supper she had brought down to him. He felt that he\n\nneeded it all for his great journey. It might be days before he could\n\nget another such supper. It was quite dark outside when he had finished.\n\n\n\nBut there were lights upstairs and sounds of voices. Buster sat down\n\nand waited until they had all gone to bed, and the house was as quiet\n\nas a mouse. Then he got up and began preparing for his escape. The\n\nwindows were out of the question, for they were too small for him to\n\ncrawl through. So he devoted himself to breaking through the outside\n\ndoor.\n\n\n\nThis was locked, but Buster leaned his heavy weight against it until\n\nthe lock creaked and then snapped. The door sprung open so suddenly\n\nthat he tumbled outside all in a heap. The night was clear and quiet.\n\nThe noise made by the bursting of the lock did not seem to disturb\n\nanybody, and Buster started across the fields in a slow jog trot.\n\n\n\nWhen he reached the border of the swamp, he skirted the edge instead\n\nof plunging through it. He finally came out on the road where he had\n\nfrightened the man carrying a basket of pies and rolls. He smiled at\n\nthe remembrance of it, and wondered if the man would come again with\n\nanother basketful of good things.\n\n\n\nBuster had started out with the intention of finding his way back to\n\nthe North Woods, but he soon found himself in a quandary. Which way\n\nshould he go to find them? And how far off were they?\n\n\n\nHe might have been compelled, after all, to return to the little girl’s\n\nhouse and go to the Zoo for the rest of his days, if he hadn’t stumbled\n\nby accident upon Sleepy the Opossum cuddled up in a crotch of a tree.\n\n\n\n“Hello, Sleepy,” he called, “can you direct me to the North Woods, and\n\ntell me how far I must travel to reach them?”\n\n\n\n“Follow the wind, Buster,” replied Sleepy, “and travel day and night\n\nuntil you get there. That’s all I know.”\n\n\n\nThe wind was blowing from the north, and after traveling in that\n\ndirection all night, crossing fields, woods and swamps, he came to rest\n\nin a dense thicket. “I’ll sleep here,” he said, “until night, and then\n\ngo on.”\n\n\n\nHe didn’t want to show himself in the day time, and so he slept soundly\n\nall day. When he stretched himself toward sundown, he saw Curly the\n\nSkunk nearby watching.\n\n\n\n“How far is it to the North Woods, Curly?” he asked. “And which way do\n\nI go?”\n\n\n\n“It’s far again as you’ve traveled, Buster,” was the reply, “and it\n\nwill take you twice as long to reach it, for there’s a big river to\n\ncross. Follow the moon, and you won’t miss it.”\n\n\n\nBuster thanked him for this information, and as there was a bright moon\n\nhe had no trouble in keeping in the right direction. As on the previous\n\nnight he traveled until the dawn of a new day, and then once more\n\nsought refuge in a dense swamp to sleep.\n\n\n\nHe was awake bright and early, rising before the moon was up. This time\n\nhe asked Washer the Raccoon, who responded promptly:\n\n\n\n“Follow the trail made by White Tail the Deer until you come to the\n\nriver. Then cross it, if you can. It’s a long swim, and I wouldn’t like\n\nto undertake it.”\n\n\n\nAgain Buster thanked his little forest friend, and resumed his hard\n\njourney. He was pretty tired and dirty by this time, for he had walked\n\nthrough swamps and thickets of briars in the dark, and had fallen and\n\nstumbled a number of times. But he had to reach the North Woods where\n\nhe would be in no further danger of capture. Now that he had decided to\n\nreturn to his old home, he wasn’t going to be turned aside by anything.\n\n\n\nHe reached the bank of the river by dawn. It was certainly a wide\n\nriver, and very swift. He walked in it and drank his fill of cool,\n\nrefreshing water. Seeing Billy the Mink washing himself on the bank, he\n\ncalled to him: “Must I swim the river to reach the North Woods, Billy?”\n\n\n\n“You certainly must,” laughed Billy, “unless you can fly across. You\n\nhaven’t wings yet, have you, Buster?”\n\n\n\n“Not yet, Billy.”\n\n\n\nThen taking a plunge in the deep, swift stream, Buster began his long\n\nswim. The current was so strong that it carried him far down from the\n\npoint he had in view, and at times it seemed as if he wasn’t making\n\nany headway at all. His long tramp in the woods began to tell on him,\n\nand he puffed and grunted as never before.\n\n\n\nBut he was a powerful swimmer, and in time his feet touched sandy\n\nbottom on the other side. He waded through the shallow water until he\n\nstood on dry land once more.\n\n\n\n“My, Buster, you look like a drowned rat!” exclaimed a voice in the\n\nbushes. He turned to see Groundy the Woodchuck smiling at him. “When\n\ndid you arrive?” continued Groundy. “And how big you’ve grown! I hardly\n\nknew you at first.”\n\n\n\n“How far am I from the North Woods, Browny?” Buster interrupted.\n\n\n\n“How far? Why, as far again as half.”\n\n\n\n“This is no time for joking, Browny. I want a plain, straightforward\n\nanswer.”\n\n\n\n“Well, then you’ll have it. You’re there now! You’re standing in the\n\nNorth Woods!”\n\n\n\nBuster gave a little sigh of relief. So he was back home, in the woods\n\nwhere had been born! How good the trees and bushes looked and smelt! He\n\nsniffed the pines and spruces. He looked at the river he had crossed,\n\nand for the first time realized this was the stream that passed the\n\ndoor of his old home. By following it up he could come to the cave\n\nwhere his mother had lived, and where Loup the Lynx had found him that\n\nday when he tried to kill him.\n\n\n\nIf you want to hear more of Buster’s life you can follow him in the\n\nbook “Buster the Big Brown Bear’s Adventures.”\n\n"]
